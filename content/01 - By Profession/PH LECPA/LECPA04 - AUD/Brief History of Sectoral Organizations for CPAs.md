As preparations were being made for the observance of the 50th Anniversary or Golden Jubilee of the accounting profession on the following year (1973), a Commission on Integration under the Board of Accountancy was created by a Presidential Proclamation. Said Commission was charged with the responsibility of mapping out the plans for the celebration.

The Commission realized that after more than four decades of existence, PICPA had in its rolls barely 20% of its potential membership. The Commission then decided to organize sectoral associations, which would be more effective in drawing CPAs into membership. It was widely recognized that by then, CPAs has drifted from the field of public accounting as originally conceived in the accountancy law creating the title “Certified Public Accountants” into allied fields such as private or management accounting, education and consultancy among others. CPAs in these fields were generally reluctant to join PICPA which was identified as open only for CPAs in public service.

Consequently, it was agreed to form CPA associations for those engaged in the major areas of accounting practice. To name: GACPA for those in government; ACPACI for those in commerce and industry; and, ACPAE for those in education.

The formation of ACPAPP for CPAs in Public practice was deferred as PICPA then could still serve the purpose.
