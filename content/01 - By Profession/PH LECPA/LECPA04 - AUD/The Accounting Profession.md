| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Filipino Citizen                | Birth Certificate                                                   |
| Good Moral Character            | NBI Clearance                                                       |
| Graduate of the [[BSA Program|BSA Program]] | Transcript of Records marked with *for board examination purposes*. |

> **Exception**: subjects or citizens of foreign countries with reciprocity may practice the Accountancy Profession in the Philippines subject to the provisions of the treaty or law governing for the same.

Note that individuals who have taken the licensure examinations despite being unqualified in the first place, or based on these grounds, will not be oath as a Certified Public Accountant:

2. Unsound mind.
3. Moral turpitude.
4. Misrepresentation.

### Grades in LE
An individual shall have the following grades in order to **pass** the licensure examination:
1. An average grade of 75 for all subjects; and
2. A minimum grade of 65 for each subject

If anyone shall have an average grade of lower than 75 but a grade of 75 for the majority of the subjects taken and a minimum grade of 65 for the remainder, they shall receive **conditional credits** to the subjects with a grade of 75 and above, and the remaining subjects be retaken within a period of 2 years. The initial examination, as well as the retaken subjects, only count as one examination. The grade requirements for the retake subjects shall still follow the general guidelines of grade requirements to pass the LE.

If a grade falls below the 65 threshold (i.e., 64.99 and below), they are considered to have **failed** the licensure examinations and may retake the examinations.[^1] Individuals who shall retake and consecutively fail the licensure examinations for 2 times shall take a refresher of 24 units.

The Board shall submit to the Commission the ratings obtained by each candidate 10 calendar days after the conclusion of the LE.

[^2]: The terms *initial* and *continuing* are not official terms used in law. I just used them because it makes explanation easier.
