## Preliminaries
- Part of ReSA for 14 years
- Became Chair of Accountancy Department at UST
- Things to prepare:
	- Always remind yourself when taking the board exam. The reason must be something for your own end.
	- Pass the LECPA:
		- Time management and discipline (hard-proof)
		- To pass the LECPA:
			- Grade average of 75
			- Grade above 65 for all subjs
	- More effort != better grades
		- Work smarter, not harder
- Don’t be first, but don’t be last, too.
- Proper time management → Are you allocating the right time?
- Focus on topics that you do not know.
- If you want to be a top-notcher, your primary opponent will be your own self.
- As an accountant:
	- Increase revenue
	- Decrease expenses
	- Ensure compliance
- Reasons for failing board exams:
	- Lack of competence
		- Tamaan mo na yung mga topics na hindi mo alam bago pa ma-discuss ‘yon
	- Lack of speed (in answering the board exams)
		- Mind is unreliable unless written
		- Pwede magsulat sa questionnaires :>
		- Composure
		- Skip long but low-return questions (i.e., long questions but only one point equiv.)
- Lack of endurance
- Testmanship
