## Notes
- Partnership Formation and Capital Accounts
	- Recording of net assets
		- Assets acquired recorded at agreed values, or fair market values
		- Liabilities are always recorded at net present value
	- *Capital* account is used for permanent withdrawals and additional contributions
	- *Drawing* account is used for net income or loss, and personal or normal withdrawals
	- *Loans* account is used for loaned capital to the partnership
		- In liquidation, a loan is considered as an increase or decrease in a partner’s capital account
- Division of Profits and Losses
	- Dividing for profits and losses generally follow what is written in the contract when the partnership was incorporated.
		- This one must always be consulted first, whether there exists a law or not providing therefor, because no law shall impair the obligation on contracts. (?)
		- The division for losses is the same as that of how profits are divided, unless the contrary is provided
	- **SPECIAL NOTE**: Ownership interests is independent from ratio of profits and losses.
	- Methods for dividing:
		- Equally
		- Arbitrary ratio (or agreed upon based on agreement)
		- Capital contribution ratio based on:
			- Original capital (when the partnership was formed)
				- Also used in the absence of an agreement for dividing profits or losses
			- Beginning capital each year
			- Average capital (or weighted average; most fair)
			- Ending capital each year
		- Interest on capital and/or loan balances
		- Salaries (based on agreed ratio)
		- Bonuses (based on agreed ratio)
		- Interest on capitals
- Dissolution
	- Whenever there is a change in the composition of the partnership, it undergoes dissolution and creation of a new partnership again (note that partnerships are formed through contracts. Therefore, if a contract is changed, the old provisions become defunct and the new one shall be the one to be executory)
	- Admission of a new partner
		- Purchase of interest
			- Admission of a new partner by purchasing the interest of an existing partner
			- Price paid for that interest is irrelevant. What is relevant is the transfer or acquisition of said interest from the old to the new partner.
		- Admission by investment of additional assets
			- Bonus method ← preferred
				- Debit net assets acquired, credit agreed percentage of total capital
					- Total capital = Old BV of partnership + FV of assets by new partner
				- Difference between FMV of assets contributed and interest granted to new partner results to bonus
					- No bonus (no difference)
					- Bonus granted to old partners (FMV > interest)
					- Bonus granted to new partners (FMV < interest)
			- Goodwill method ← defunct
				- By virtue of IFRS 3 because goodwill attaches only to a business as a whole **and** is recognized only when a business is **acquired**.
	- Withdrawal of a partner
		- Interest of a partnership should first be properly determined:
			- Share in the profit and loss of the partnership
			- Adjustments in assets and liabilities to reflect FMV
			- Loans to and from partnership
			- Drawing account
			- Capital interest/account
		- Can be done thru:
			- Selling of interest to outsider
			- Selling of interest to existing partner
				- Note that the existing partner should purchase the interest of the withdrawing partner using their **personal assets** and not that of the partnership.
			- Selling of interest to the partnership, or payment from partnership fund
				- Payment of book value
				- Payment at less than book value → bonus method
				- Payment at more than book value → bonus method
	- Incorporation of a partnership
		- The books of the partnership is retained, and the net assets @FMV, then a common stock account is opened
		- The books of the partnership is closed, and a new set of books is opened. Net assets is also recorded @FMV
- Liquidation
	- Usually, the sale of assets will not provide sufficient cash to pay both creditors and partners. Hence, the creditors have priority on any distribution
		- Unjust enrichment principle? That no one shall be unduly enriched? refer to Civil Code
	- An individual prematurely distributing cash to a partner whose capital account later shows a deficit maybe held personally liable if the insolvent partner is unable to repay such as distribution.
		- Lump Sum Distribution
		- Instalment Distributions
