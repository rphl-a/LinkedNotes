## Preliminaries

## Notes
- Formation of Partnership
	- Definition of partnership
		- Contract between two or more persons
		- Bind themselves to contribute money, property, or industry in a common fund
			- Money or property → Capitalist partner
			- Industry → Industrial partner
				- If solely industry, then there is no Capital balance (or 0) upon Partnership Formation. However, during partnership operation, it may change due to division of profit among themselves.
		- With intention of dividing the profits among themselves
			- A partnership *cannot* be organized for non-profit
	- Measurement of assets, by order
		- Agreed value by the partners, seeing that the nature of a partnership is consensual by nature
		- Fair/market/quoted value
			- **Appraised value**
			- Note: assessed value is for the valuation of tax due.
		- Carrying/Book value
	- Adjustment of Capital balances:
		- Transfer of capital ← default, if the problem is silent
		- Investment/withdrawal
- Partnership Operation
	- When dividing profits and losses, it shall conform to the agreement established by the partners.
	- Note that the provision of interests, salaries, and bonuses are ==methods to divide the net income==, and not to compute the net income.
		- Managing partner usually has bonus set on a base, such as the amount of sales for a period. Bonuses are only provided in case of net income based on agreement by the partners.
			- There is always no bonus in net loss
			- There may be bonus in net income (because after provision of salaries and interests, remainder may be net loss, or there is no agreement between by the partners).
	- The remainder of the net income is also distributed to the partners.
	- If resulting to net loss, then use the loss ratio, or profit ratio if not provided for. If the P&L ratio is not provided, then use the original capital ratios.
		- Industrial partners may not share in net losses of the partnership.
	- If resulting to net income, then use the profit ratio. If the P&L ratio is not provided, then:
		- Just and equitable compensation to industrial partners (provided by Civil Code)
		- Original capital ratios to capitalist partners.
