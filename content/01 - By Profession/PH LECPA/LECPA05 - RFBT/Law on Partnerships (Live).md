## Preliminaries
- Expectation is that quick videos/pre-recorded videos was already watched
- Focus on the fundamentals

## Notes
- RA 386 **Article 1767.** By the contract of partnership two or more persons bind themselves to contribute money, property, or industry to a common fund, with the intention of dividing the profits among themselves.
	- Elements of a valid partnership agreement
		- Valid Contract
			- Based on trust and confidence (fiduciary)
			- Governed by delectus personae
				- Freedom to choose who they want to associate with in a partnership
				- No want may be compelled to be a partner, or be chosen to stay, in a partnership
			- Law on Contract: manner by which the contract is perfected, because only such time when it is perfected, only such contract becomes binding
			- Mere meeting of minds already creates a valid partnership
		- Valid object/purpose
			- A1409 of Civil Code
				- If the object is illicit or illegal, it has no force of law
		- Mutual contributions to a common fund
			- Money
			- Property
			- Industry
		- There must be intention to divide profits
			- Law uses the term “profits”, what if incurred a loss?
				- It is still considered a partnership
				- Inherent to also share losses in the partnership
	- Doctrine of separate juridical personality will be in effect once the valid elements are present
		- Assets and liabilities of partnership are separate and distinct from the partners
			- There may be instances where form is relevant to the form of partnership
				- If Real/Immovable Properties are contributed
					- It must be in public instrument (through notarization)
					- Inventory of the real properties
						- List of RPs contributed to the partnership
					- In case of non-compliance, the contract will be considered void.
						- Consequently, the partnership does not acquire juridical personality.
				- If capital of partnership is PHP 3,000 or more, and there is no real/immovable properties
					- It must be in public instrument
					- Registered with the SEC
					- In case of non-compliance, the contract will still be in effect/valid. (i.e., WITH Juridical Personality)
				- In case of limited partnership
					- A limited partnership is where one partner is classified as a limited partner
					- Execute a Certificate of Limited Partnership under oath, and the partnership name must contain the words “LTD”.
					- Registered with the SEC
					- In case of non-compliance, the contract will still be in valid. However, it is only valid as a general partnership.
	- Kinds of Partnership
		- Concerned with 2 issues:
			- Basis to classify, and the reason to classify
		- As to object
			- Particular → covers a determinate thing, including the exercise of a profession
			- Universal
				- “Which will form part of common fund”
				- Of all present properties → owned by the partners from time the partner becomes a partner in the partnership, including fruits therefor.
					- Can future properties still be owned? Yes, but it will not cover properties donated to the person gratuitously, including by luck (lotto).
					- Only fruits. benefits, use, and interests therefor.
					- Asset itself remains in the ownership of partner
					- Acquired through work and industry becomes common fund.
					- 
				- Of profits → 
				- [ ] *Further research*
			- Necessity to differentiate:
				- There are certain persons who are prohibited to enter into a universal partnership
					- Prohibited from making donations to each other. Examples include husband and wife (specific term used by the law)
						- Implied that there is marriage.
						- Common law husband and wife (i.e., live ins) does not exist in PH Jurisprudence
						- However, if such persons are acting as if husband and wife but without a contract of marriage, then the prohibition still extends to them.
							- Because if not, then it is as if non-married individuals have more rights than married individuals.
		- As to liability to third persons
			- General partnership → all partners are general
			- Limited partnership → at least one partner is limited
			- Partners
				- General partner → partnership debts extend to their personal assets
					- Subsidiary → extend to their personal assets
					- Joint
					- Pro-rata
				- Limited partner → partnership debts only up to the extent of contribution in the partnership
					- Surname of limited partner shall not appear in partnership name
					- Partner cannot take active management in the partnership
					- Partner cannot take management of assets
					- *Merely as investors to the partnership*
					- In case of violation:
						- The limited partner will become liable as a general partner, but not become a general partner.
		- As to representation
			- There must be an actual partnership & all partners must have consented to the misrepresentation by the third person
			- Ordinary partnership → exists in the eyes of the partners and in the eyes of third persons
			- Estoppel partnership → rests on the concept of misrepresentation
				- Appear as a partnership when in fact there is no partnership.
				- Partnership liability → in the eyes of third person, there is a juridical person.
					- Juridical person assets, then “partners”, including the partner by estoppel.
				- Personal/joint liability → no juridical person.
					- “partner” assets
	- Types of partners (see table 1)
		- You can be a capitalist and an industrial partner at the same time. However, a limited partner can only be a capitalist partner.
		- Loss sharing may be different to that of the profit sharing agreement
		- Pro-rata → in proportion, and **not equally**.
			- When there is no industrial partner
				- Pro-rata → in proportion
					- Because if applied to industrial partners, then the industrial partner will have no share in the liability at all.
			- When there is industrial partner
				- Pro-rata → equally
	- In the eyes of creditors, share of partners in partnership debts is *pro rata*.
- Property rights
	- To share profits and surplus
	- To possess/use partnership properties
	- To management
		- Acts of administration
			- vs Acts of Strict Dominion (not)
			- [ ] *Further research*
	- To management, the principle of mutual agency applies
		- : All partners in the partnership are considered to be mutual agents with one another. Thus, the act of one partner in the ordinary course of business will be binding both in the juridical person and the partners.
			- Exception: if there is an appointed managing partners
	- Binding effect of partners:
		- Depends on three factors
			- Nature of transaction
			- Authorized to act in partnership
			- If no authority, is the third person aware of such lack in authority
		- See table 2
			- No. 5 → you cannot presume authority if beyond the normal course of business.
- Conflict Resolution
	- Go with decision of majority
	- If not, managing partners who have control
- Common debtor
	- Owed to JP and partners under personal transaction
		- ART 1792, RA 386
- **HANDOUTS**
	- Prohibition of engaging in another business:
		- Violation: profits from other business becomes common fund of the partnership
