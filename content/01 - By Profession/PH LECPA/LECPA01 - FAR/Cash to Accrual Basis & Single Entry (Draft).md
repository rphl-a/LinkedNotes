View synthesis: [[Cash to Accrual Basis|Cash to Accrual Basis]]

[[International Accounting Standard No. 01|International Accounting Standard No. 01]] states that an entity shall prepare its financial statements, except for cash flow information, using the **accrual basis of accounting**.
- An accrual basis of accounting is used when an entity recognizes items as assets, liabilities, equity, income, and expenses **when they satisfy the definitions and recognition criteria** for those elements provided under the Conceptual Framework.

However, an entity may use cash basis of accounting for simplicity purposes, which is most useful for small businesses or for use internally by the organization.
- A cash basis of accounting is used when an entity recognizes items as assets, liabilities, equity, income, and expenses **when the cash is received by the entity**.

The preferred method under [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles|Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]] is accrual basis of accounting. However, in some cases, it is more preferred for an entity to report its financial statements using cash basis of accounting.

The table below summarizes the difference between accrual and cash basis of accounting:

| Item                    | Cash basis                                                           | Accrual basis                                                     |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sales                   | Cash sales plus collection of trade receivables                      | Cash sales plus sales on account                                  |
| Purchases               | Cash purchases plus payments to trade creditors                      | Cash purchases plus purchases on account                          |
| Income other than sales | Items received are considered as income regardless of when earned    | Items earned are considered as income regardless of when received |
| Expenses in general     | Items paid are treated as expenses regardless of when incurred       | Items incurred are treated as expenses regardless of when paid    |
| Depreciation            | Depreciation is provided normally                                    | Depreciation is provided normally                                 |
| Bad debts               | No bad debts are recorded because trade receivables are not recorded | Doubtful accounts are treated as bad debts                        |

## T-account approach
Ordinarily, using the t-account approach will greatly help in converting cash basis of accounting to accrual. Simply provide for the normal balances in a t-account, then provide for the total.

### Computation of Sales

| Debit                                 | Credit                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |     |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Trade and notes receivable, beginning | Cash sales<br>Trade and notes receivable, end<br>Collection of trade and notes receivable<br>Sales returns, discounts, and allowances<br>Trade and notes receivable written off<br>Trade notes receivable discounted (net) |     |
|                                       | Sales (under accrual basis)                                                                                                                                                                                                |     |

All the items on the right side, except for *cash sales*, all have normal credit balances that affect sale- that is, the ending balance of trade and notes receivable represent the amount of sales credit to be collected from customers at the end of the accounting period. Hence, we add it.

Note that the process is reversed if converting from accrual to cash basis (i.e., debit line items become credit, and credit-line items become debit). What remains constant is the cash/credit sales.

### Computation of Purchases

| Debit                                                                                                                               | Credit                             |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Cash purchases<br>Trade and notes payable, end<br>Payment of trade and notes payable<br>Purchase returns, discounts, and allowances | Trade and notes payable, beginning |
| Purchases (under accrual basis)                                                                                                     |                                    |

### Income other than sales

| Debit                                             | Credit                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Deferred income, end<br>Accrued income, beginning | Income received (cash)<br>Deferred income, beginning<br>Accrued income, end |
|                                                   | Income recognized (accrual)                                                 |

For income other than sales, two familiar terms emerge: [[Deferred income|Deferred income]] (credit) and [[Accrued income|Accrued income]] (debit).

### Expense other than purchases

| Debit                                                                        | Credit                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Expenses paid (cash)<br>Prepaid expenses, beginning<br>Accrued expenses, end | Prepaid expenses, end<br>Accrued expenses, beginning |
| Expenses paid (accrual)                                                      |                                                      |  

Notice that we also use [[Prepaid expense|Prepaid expense]] (debit) and [[Accrued expense|Accrued expense]] (credit).

> Notice how prepaid accounts have the same normal balances to their income/expense counterpart: Deferred income has a credit balance in that sales also has a credit balance, and v.v. 
> 
> But Accruals have the opposite normal balances to their income/expense counterpart: Accrued income has a debit balance in that sales has a credit balance instead, and v.v.
