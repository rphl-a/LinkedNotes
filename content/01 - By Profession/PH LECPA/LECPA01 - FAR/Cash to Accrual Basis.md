title: Cash to Accrual Basis - Synthesis

---

## Introduction
[[International Accounting Standard No. 01|International Accounting Standard No. 01]] states that an entity shall prepare its financial statements, *except for cash flow information*, using *accrual basis of accounting*. However, in some cases, an entity may use *cash basis of accounting* for simplicity purposes. This is common most especially for small businesses, or if the data to be used will only be used within the organization.
- An accrual basis of accounting is used when an entity recognizes items as assets, liabilities, equity, income, and expenses *when they satisfy the definitions and recognition criteria* provided under the Conceptual Framework. This is also the preferred method under the [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles|Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]].
- A cash basis of accounting is used when an entity recognizes its assets, liabilities, equity, income, and expenses *when the cash is received by the entity* regardless of when the economic event was incurred or rendered.

## Usage
The preferred method to convert cash to accrual basis of accounting is to use the T-account method, which are as follow:
1. Identify the normal balance of an account.
	1. Accounts with normal debit balances go to the left side of the t-account.[^1]
	2. Accounts with normal credit balances go to the right side of the t-account.[^1]
	3. Cash collections attributable to a nominal account used in accrual basis (i.e., purchases[^2]) also go on the left side (always).
	4. Cash collections attributable to a nominal account used in accrual basis (i.e., sales[^2]) also go to the right side (always).
2. The balance of the t-account represents the converted balance of a particular account under accrual basis of accounting.

[^1]: When converting from accrual to cash basis instead, accounts with normal debit balances go to the right side of the t-account, and vice versa. It is reversed. Also note that some accounts, such as allowance for bad debts, are not present when converting to cash basis. As such, they are ignored.
[^2]: Payments made for sales or purchase returns are removed from the balance when computing for net sales or purchases, respectively.
