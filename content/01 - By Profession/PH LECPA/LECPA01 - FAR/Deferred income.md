Deferred income refer to those items under accrual basis of accounting that recognizes income or expense as soon as cash has been involved. It is also known as **unearned income**. There are two methods to recognize deferred income:
- *Liability method*, wherein income is only recognized when the entity renders the service to their customers. It involves the 
- *Income method*, wherein income is recognized by the entity as long as cash is already received by the same.

It has a normal **credit** balance (and it also follows the normal balance of an income).

| Recognition | Liability Method                        | Income Method                           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Initial     | Cash received, as unearned income       | Cash received, as earned income         |
| Year-end    | Earned income of unearned is recognized | Unearned income of earned is recognized |
| New period  | No reversing entries                    | Reversing entries required              |

## Example
An entity collected PHP 12,000 from its customers on April 01, 2024, for services to be rendered for 12 months. Each month, the company renders its services to their customers in the sum of PHP 1,000.

| Recognition | Liability Method                          | Income Method                             |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Initial     | d.Cash 12,000<br>C.Unearned Income 12,000 | d.Cash 12,000<br>c.Income 12,000          |
| At year-end | d.Unearned Income 9,000<br>C.Income 9,000 | d.Income 3,000<br>C.Unearned Income 3,000 |

In effect, both methods will show the following balances in the financial statement:
- Unearned income of PHP 9,000
- Income of PHP 3,000

Then, at the beginning of a new reporting period, the adjustments made at year-end under the income method are reversed to ensure consistency to the accounting basis used by the organization.

| Recognition | Liability Method | Income Method                             |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| New period  | N/A              | d.Unearned Income 3,000<br>C.Income 3,000 |
