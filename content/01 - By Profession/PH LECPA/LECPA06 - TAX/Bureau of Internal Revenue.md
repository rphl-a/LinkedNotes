The Bureau of Internal Revenue is a government agency tasked with the collection of all internal revenue taxes, fees, and charges, as well as the enforcement of all forfeitures, penalties, and fines connected with these including the execution of judgements for which is has police powers.

It is under the Department of Finance, headed by incumbent Secretary Ralph Recto, and the bureau itself headed by incumbent Commissioner Romeo D. Lumagui Jr.

> Note: Custom duties, as determined by the Tariff Classifications, are under the administration of the [[Bureau of Customs|Bureau of Customs]], which is also under the [[Department of Finance|Department of Finance]]. However, the payment of Value-Added Tax on imports accrue to the Bureau of Internal Revenue, with the Bureau of Customs merely collecting what is due therefor.

## History & Structure
Prior to the Spanish colonization regime, the Philippines was organized into barangays, each ruled by datus (or *rajahs* in some areas) that offered protection to its subordinates. Tax (called *buwis, handug, or handog*) was paid by the people in forms of crops and goods during this time.

Then, during the Spanish Colonization Era, a *Contador de Resultas* acted as the Chief Royal Accountant in the Philippines. A *cedula* system was established during this era, which replaced the prior *tributo* system. This form of system collected tax from Filipinos in the form of *reales*.

It is not only until the colonization of the American regime that the Bureau came to be, through the Reorganization Act No. 1189 (July 2, 1904). However, during the Japanese Colonization Era, it was combined with the Customs Office and headed by a Director of Customs and Internal Revenue. It was then re-established separately from the Customs Office after the war. 

Thereafter, succeeding administrations also implemented multiple policies for the benefit of the Bureau. Notable ones include the provision of a Tax Account Number (TAN) during the Marcos administration, introduction of Value-Added Tax during the C. Aquino administration, the appointment of its first lady Commissioner, Liwayway Vinzons-Chato during the Ramos administration, the *Humingi ng Resibo, Manalo ng Libo-Libo* program by the Estrada administration, the establishment of the Electronic Filing and Payment System (eFPS) by the Arroyo administration, the Tax Reform and Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) and the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises (CREATE) laws during the Duterte administration, and the CREATE MORE Act during the Marcos Jr. administration.
