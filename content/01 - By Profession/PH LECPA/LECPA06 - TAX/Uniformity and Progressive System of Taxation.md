Under the 1987 Philippine Constitution, it mandates the Congress to create laws that is uniform and equitable, and to evolve a progressive system of taxation. Thus read:

> **ARTICLE VI SECTION 28(1)**. The rule of taxation shall be uniform and equitable. The Congress shall evolve a progressive system of taxation.

Meaning, taxation laws **should be** uniform and equitable. 

However, a progressive system of taxation is not required. The Philippine Constitution merely requires the Congress to *evolve* a progressive system of taxation, but is not limited to a progressive style of taxation. This is in accordance with a Supreme Court ruling, which partly read:

> The Constitution does not really prohibit the imposition of indirect taxes which, like the VAT, are regressive. What it simply provides is that Congress shall "*evolve* a progressive system of taxation." The constitutional provision has been interpreted to mean simply that "direct taxes are . . . to be preferred (and) as much as possible, indirect taxes should be minimized." (E. FERNANDO, THE CONSTITUTION OF THE PHILIPPINES 221 (Second ed. (1977)). Indeed, the mandate to Congress is not to *prescribe*, but to *evolve*, a progressive tax system. Otherwise, sales taxes, which perhaps are the oldest form of indirect taxes, would have been prohibited with the proclamation of Art. VIII, §17(1) of the 1973 Constitution from which the present Art. VI, §28(1) was taken. Sales taxes are also regressive.
> 
> Resort to indirect taxes should be *minimized* but not *avoided* entirely because it is difficult, if not impossible, to avoid them by imposing such taxes according to the taxpayers' ability to pay.  
> —*Tolentino vs Secretary of Finance*, G.R. No. 115455 (and others)

This limitation is consistent with the Ability to Pay theory.

## On Double Taxation…

> [!tip]+ Rule against double taxation  
> The rule against double taxation is also not a constitutional nor an inherent limitation. However, it is given consideration by legislators, such as if an object of taxation is taxed doubly, then either of them may be exempted from tax.
