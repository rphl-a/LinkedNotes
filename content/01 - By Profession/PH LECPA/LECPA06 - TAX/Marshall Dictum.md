The Marshall Dictum is an important [[Taxation Doctrines|taxation doctrine]] which primarily relate to a landmark case by the United States of America’s Supreme Court during the term of Chief Justice John Marshall between *James McCulloch* and *The State of Maryland, represented by John James*.

The case (17 U.S. 316) involved the legality of the national bank and a tax that the state of Maryland imposed on it. Among other things, it stated that the American federal government is supreme over the states, and so, the latter’s ability to interfere with the federal government is restricted.

It is also been described as the most important Supreme Court decision in U.S. history in defining the scope of the powers vested in the Congress, as well as delineating the relationship between the federal government and the states.
