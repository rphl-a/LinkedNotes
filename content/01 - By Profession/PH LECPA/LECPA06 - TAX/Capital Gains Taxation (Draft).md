## Notes
- Capital gains and final tax are the exemptions to income tax. If it is not subjected to FIT or CGT, then it is subject to regular income tax.
	- Capital gains is imposed on gains from disposal of capital assets.
		- Capital assets → those assets other than ordinary assets. (a residual definition)
			- Ordinary assets → properties used in business; Provided:
				- It is held for ==sale== in the course of business (in FAR terms, inventories), or
				- It is held for ==use== in the course of business (in FAR terms, supplies, and PPEs)
				- Investment in assets (those for rentals) considered as ordinary assets.
		- Segregate the personal properties of the business owner (i.e., home, clothes, etc.). These are considered as capital assets.
		- Kung baga:
			- Personal → Capital asset
			- Business → Capital or ordinary asset
		- Capital assets:
			- Financial assets under FAR → cash, receivables, prepayments, etc.
			- Intangible assets under FAR → examples are franchise, IP rights, goodwill, etc.
		- Assets are properties of a taxpayer.
		- Only two classification of assets as defined under NIRC.
		- Capital gain → Capital asset
		- Ordinary gain → Ordinary asset
		- The line that separates the definition between capital and ordinary assets lie on the ==nature== of the taxpayer’s business. However:
			- For banks, real and other properties acquired are those that:
				- are acquired by reason of nature of business (i.e., collaterals and foreclosure of properties)
				- These are *ordinary assets*
			- For finance companies, loan receivables are considered as ordinary assets.
				- [ ] Sabi capital asset? further investigation required
		- For assets sold or abandoned, or something:
			- Once you use a property in a business, it is already considered as an ordinary asset.
			- Assets that are fully depreciated and still used in business, then it is still considered as an ordinary asset
			- If an asset is acquired ==to be used== in business, it remains as an ordinary asset.
				- If an asset was formerly used as capital asset, then acquired to be used in business, then it is considered as an ordinary asset.
			- If an asset is previously used in business, then abandoned later on (or stoppage of regular use), it is automatically becomes a capital asset in 2 years from discontinuance of active use.
				- Applicable to all taxpayers except:
					- Businesses engaged in real estate (real property developer, lessor, and dealers)
					- 6 real property sales in the prior year of a taxpayer
- Ordinary assets → ordinary gains/loss → subject to regular income tax
- Capital assets:
	- Capital gain or loss → either capital gains tax or regular income tax, depending on the classification of asset
- **Capital gains tax** is a system of “final tax”, and imposed on:
	- **Domestic stocks directly to a buyer (`15%` CGT)** *annual* (w/ transactional filing)
		- Involves withholding at source (i.e., only a *final tax* by name; requires self-assessment method)
		- Things to note:
			- Includes sale or exchange of domestic stocks directly to a buyer, as well as other disposition.
			- Other disposition → involves onerous settlement, such as mortgages or expropriated by the government.
		- Stocks → equity securities of an entity; of a corporation
			- Interest in a business partnership is not included as *stocks*.
			- *Stocks* may also include membership of an organization.
			- *Bonds are debt instrument, and as such, not considered as such*.
			- Remember: domestic corporation → organized under PH laws
				- “Corporation” as a juridical entity
		- *directly to buyer* (i.e., unlisted shares)
			- Other mode: thru the Philippine Stock Exchange (i.e., listed shares of a company). These are not included.
				- These are under stock transaction tax (percentage tax) (6/10 of 1% of gross selling price, whether a gain or a loss).
				- **No income tax!**
					- [ ] **TODO**: Contestable; other academes state otherwise. Sir Rex → w/ experience trading on PSE
					- Sabi din ng investa, no income tax, so…
				- Dealer in securities → gains thereof are subject to regular income tax and VAT.
		- **Taxation**: 15% of net gain
			- Net gain → Selling price less cost to sell (either ==specific identification, moving average, or first in first out==) less selling expenses (commission expenses by intermediaries, and remove documentary stamp tax)
				- *Not weighted average*
				- DST → obligation of either parties to the transaction. It is the tax on the exercise of rights embodied in the document.
					- Not cited by law who is the taxpayer- the buyer or the seller.
					- In practice, however, the one who is benefited from the transaction pays for the DST.
					- In the case of CGT, *remove DST if it is assumed by the seller*. If assumed by the buyer, do not include.
						- General rule, if silent: seller
			- Requires taxation reporting every 30 days
			- 15% CGT applies to all individuals or corporations, including NRA-NETB and NRFC
			- If sold at a loss, then CGT is 0 (and not negative). The overpayment is filed to the BIR for a claim of refund. *This is the current setup* hays
			- If sold at a loss, the loss is set-off to the next monthly gain. If not offset, then refund (academically?)
				- [ ] **TODO** Question to Rex: current status (since sinabi na *soon to be GAA*
		- **Compliance Requirements** (note: self assessment method):
			- Per transaction compliance
				- Every time you sell domestic stocks throughout the year (depending on the accounting period of the taxpayer), file a CGT return within 30 days of transaction.
				- **BIR FORM 1707**
			- Annual compliance
				- **BIR FORM 1707-A**
					- file on the same date of deadline for income tax returns (i.e., fourth month from end of year, +15 days)
			- Payment is generally lump-sum. However, if being paid on instalment, then instalment.
				- Instalment → only if no substantial collection. Substantial collection → if ratio of initial payment (downpayment + collections) do not exceed 25% of selling price
				- Whenever the buyer of the seller pays on instalment, look if the seller also qualifies for instalment. Seller may report instalment method to report the income of sale.
					- In the case of CGT instalment, seller may also pay tax on instalment; Provided, that initial payment must not exceed 25% of the selling price.
		- **Wash sales** → feigned/fake sales intended to reduce reported capital gains tax. *They create fictitious losses to offset their gains. It also happens both for securities, such as stocks and bonds.*
			- Only applies to capital assets.
			- Create separate note
			- Concept of buy low sell high
			- Deliberate understatement of cost. Hence, ==Wash Sales Rule==
				- 10,000 initial cost, sold at 6,000; 4,000 loss
				- Bought at 6,000 again.
				- The initial 4,000 loss is added to the 6,000 on second transaction. The 4,000 loss is not deductible.
				- Net amount: 10,000 cost pa din
				- Only applies 61 days from day of loss/disposal. 61 days from such period prohibits the recognition of wash sales within a period of 30 days after the day of disposal and 30 days before the day of disposal. Day 1 is the date of disposal itself.
				- Only applies to losses and on the same type of share (i.e., within the same company and same type)
					- Also applies to bonds (i.e., same rate and same term; identically same type of security)
				- Full cover up: if subsequent buyback is greater or equal to sell amount. Full loss is added to subsequent buyback.
					- For two transactions in between, the denominator is the number of shares sold at day of loss, or the total number of shares bought in between, whichever is higher. This ratio is multiplied to the loss realized in the day of loss.
				- Partial cover up: is less.
					- Treatment: 800/1000 covered up (ratio) → added to cost
					- 200/1000 not covered up (ratio) → deductible loss to CGT
				- Always check number of stocks. Price of shares is irrelevant.
			- 
	- **Real property (as capital asset) (`6%` CGT)** *transactional*
		- Does not involve withholding at source (i.e., *actually* a final tax; uses final withholding method)
		- Basis o tax is either the fair market value or the gross selling price, whichever is higher
			- NIRC FMV → the higher of the zonal value or the FV per tax declaration, whichever is higher
				- Zonal value only exists on land; there is no valuation by the BIR when it comes to improvements
				- FV per tax declaration → as declared by the taxpayer
					- FV per tax declared is different from assessed level
						- Assessed level → multiplied by ratio provided for by LGU, or by the Local Government Code
		- What we are taxing is the fair market value or the gross selling price, and not the gain. *In this type of tax, gain is conclusively presumed*.
			- No exception, even under expropriation/made under power of eminent domain. Even if seized by bank due to inability to pay of mortgage. Includes exchange of properties.
				- If a property is foreclosed, there is a 1 year redemption period
		- By nature, it is a *final tax* and a *transactional tax*.
		- Disposal of properties is subject to documentary stamp tax, which shall be `15/1000` of FMV or GSP, whichever is higher
			- Or 1.5%
			- 10 days after EOM
		- **COMPLIANCE**: File a return 30 days after date of sale
		- Scope: all individuals and domestic corpos
			- Foreign corps cannot own rps in ph. subject to regular tax
		- **Exceptions**
			- Exemption Rule → CGT will be 0.
				- Exception vs exemption
				- Replacement of residence (i.e., home); Provided:
					- Filipino citizen (resident or non-resident)
					- Alien resident
					- Replacing *principal* residence
						- Theoretically, this is where you are currently living, or your family is currently living as contained in your tax dec (Real proeprty tax of your residence)
					- Time period between disposal and purchase of new residence shall be in a period of 18 months, or upon completion of construction
						- Exception: if di pa tapos, dapat may contract to buy that is executed with third party
					- Availed once every 10 years
					- Presumptive cost of old is the presumptive cost of new
					- May also include escrow accounts in favour of the government
					- Things to note:
						- The old residence must be sold first before buying a new one
					- Replacement → strictly saying, money/proceeds from old house is used to buy a new house
			- Alternative Taxation Rule → either 6% CGT or RIT.
				- Allowed if property is sold to the government, or expropriated to the government.
					- Corporate property → only 6% CGT
					- alt because expropriation can be harsh
	- All other assets, it is subject to regular income tax
	- **Tax-free Exchanges**, or *Corporate re-adjustment* (for stonks)
		- Some transactions are considered as non-earning transactions.
		- They are tax free because they do not generate any form of revenue between two parties. Separate page, because it will be recalled in VAT.
		- Initial acquisition of corporate control
			- When you alone, or up to 4 other people (max 5), cumulatively, took control of a corporation.
				- Control, in accounting, is at least 50% ownership of the voting power of the corporation.
				- In tax, it is at least 51% ownership.
			- It is considered as investing in a corporation.
		- Share-for-share swap in pursuant to a plan of merger or consolidation
			- *Business combination*. B shares is exchanged for A shares if merely for ==merger or consolidation== intents.
			- The implied gain upon receipt of other asset is recognized.
				- Ex.: FV 20K; Cost 15K
					- For exchange of stocks, its indicated gain is not taxable.
				- Ex.: FV 18K shares; FV 2K land; Cost 15K
					- 18K shares → no gain recognized
					- 2K land → there is gain recognized. Of the total indicated gain, 2K is realized gain.
					- Realized gain (if any) is as a result of exchange of other assets for the consideration. Excess is considered as *return of capital*.
				- In same example, new cost of A shares is:
					- 15K old cost
					- - other properties given
					- - return of capital (total realized gain from transaction)
					- 15K new cost
