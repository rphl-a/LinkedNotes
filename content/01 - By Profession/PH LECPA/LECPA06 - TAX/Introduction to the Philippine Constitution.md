The 1987 Philippine Constitution is the supreme law of the land governing the function of the government and the rights of its citizens. It encapsulates the will of the people, this being a charter enacted by the people of the Philippines.

The Philippine Constitution provided for the creation of three co-equal departments of the National Government, the Local Governments, and the independent Constitutional Commissions.

## The Philippine Government
The Philippines is a democratic and republican state. It is governed by a government called The Philippine Government, or sometimes referred to as the National Government, and the Local Governments over the various administrative divisions that exist in the Philippines.

The National Government is divided into three co-equal departments. As co-equal departments, it has their own checks and balances over its own agency and the others. They are:
- The Legislative Department, also known as the Congress, is divided into two House of Congress, namely the Senate and the House of Representatives. They make laws for the welfare of the public.
- The Executive Department, or the Executive Branch, is a component of the government tasked with executing the provisions of the Philippine Constitution and its laws. Also read: [Administrative Code of 1987 (not yet done)](../../../11%20-%20Philippine%20Statutes/EO%20292%20s.%201987/INSTITUTING%20THE%20ADMINISTRATIVE%20CODE%20OF%201987.md)
- The Judicial Department, reigned by the Supreme Court and such other lower courts as may be provided by law, is tasked with settling controversies and interpretations of the law (or Judicial Review)

Adhering to the Doctrine of Separation of Powers, each department has distinct and non-overlapping functions over one another.

> As an example, the Legislative Department creates laws for the country. They may also impeach erring public officers in the Executive or Judicial Department upon violation of the Philippine Constitution and its laws.
> 
> The Executive Department faithfully executes all laws enacted by the Congress. Likewise, it may also veto proposed laws sent by the Congress through the powers vested in the President.
> 
> The Judicial Department reviews the constitutionality and validity of laws enacted by the Congress and directives issued by the Executive Department. Likewise, they are composed of justices appointed by the President as recommended by the Judicial and Bar Council (JBC).

Meanwhile, the Local Government is divided into various administrative subdivisions. These administrative subdivisions both have legislative and executive authorities, which is similar to how the Legislative and Executive Departments of the National Government operates. It may be divided into the following administrative divisions, namely (and generally):
- Regions. However, regions are merely used to organize the provision of services by the National Government. The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao is the only region in the Philippines that has a regional government.
- Provinces. Its executive authority emanates from the Governor and its legislative authority emanates from the Provincial Council (or *Sangguniang Panlalawigan*).
- Municipalities. Its executive authority emanates from the Mayor and its legislative authority emanates from the Municipal/City Council (or *Sangguniang Panlungsod*).
- Barangays. Its executive authority emanates from the Barangay Captain and its legislative authority emanates from the Barangay Coincol (or *Sangguniang Barangay*)

The first- and second-level courts mimic the geographical organization of the country. First-level courts include the Metropolitan Trial Courts (MeTC), Municipal Trial Courts (MTC), Municipal Trial Courts in Cities (MTCC), and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts (MCTC), while the second-level court include the Regional Trial Court.

The third-level court is the Court of Appeals. Other courts directly one level lower to the Supreme Court include the Sandiganbayan and the Court of Tax Appeals.

> [!note]- Office of the Ombudsman  
> The Office of the Ombudsman is an agency created under Article XI of the Philippine Constitution (Accountability of Public Officers). It investigates and prosecutes public officials. Separate from the Judicial Department.

## The Constitutional Commissions
There are three independent Constitutional Commissions organized under the operation of the Philippine Constitution. Namely:
- The Civil Service Commission, which oversees the integrity of government actions and processes.
- The Commission on Audit, which examines, audits, and settles all accounts and expenditures of the government.
- The Commission on Elections, which oversees the conduct of elections, plebiscite, initiative, referendum, and recall.

> [!tip]- The necessity of being independent  
> It is necessary that these agencies be independent from the Philippine Government because the function of the former is often correlated as political by nature, so as to ensure that the functions enshrined upon these commissions be executed faithfully.
> 
> Imagine if these agencies were to be attached to a particular agency of the Philippine Government. Say, the Executive Department, which is political by nature:
> 
> - The functions of the government will be more susceptible to inaction, inefficiencies, and dishonesty.
> - The revenues and expenditures of the Philippine government will be more prone to corruption and misuse.
> - The results of an election will be at a higher risk of being fraudulent and manipulated to ensure that the officials that the officers of the commission supports win.
