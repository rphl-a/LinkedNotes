Distraint, when referred to the topic of [[Collection of taxes|Collection of taxes]], refers to the seizure of a taxpayer’s personal properties to settle the latter’s delinquent tax due to the government.

There are two methods for distraint:
- **Constructive distraint**, in which the person in possession of personal property is made to sign a receipt stating that it shall be preserved and not be disposed or transferred to anyone. Essentially, the *freezing* of a personal property;
- **Actual distraint**, in which the personal property is physically seized by the BIR and offered for sale at public auction. The proceeds of the sale are applied to the payment of the taxpayer’s delinquent tax due. *Garnishment*, which falls under this category, is the distraint of bank accounts.

A revenue district officer may authorize the distraint of one’s personal properties if the amount involved is 1M or less. If it is more than 1M, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue is responsible for such authorization.

Prior to the consummation of the sale, the taxpayer may settle to the officer all their pending tax obligation, and the possession of such property reverts to its rightful owner.
