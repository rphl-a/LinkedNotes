A piece of legislation seeking to be enacted as a national law- that is, as a Republic Act enacted by the Congress- are formulated in a step-by-step process.

The Congress is composed of two House of Congress- the House of Representatives and the Senate. The former is oftentimes referred to as the lower chamber, and the latter, as the upper chamber. *It is referred to as such because of how The Constitution of the United States of America was originally designed.*

A law sought to be enacted is first introduced as a **Bill** in either House of Congress, or both of them, which is also referred to as **Companion Bills**. Except for the provision of [[Initiative and Referendum|initiative and referendum]], only a legislator serving the Congress may introduce a legislative document.

It is then referred to a particular committee within their House of Congress, deliberated and scrutinized in accordance with the Rules as each House may provide. It may also be referred to various committees within that House.

A bill may also be referred to a committee multiple times for as long as a legislator successfully motions for its referral. After all committee deliberations conclude, printed copies are sent to the legislators of that House of Congress three days before its eyed passage. Bills are required to have passed three readings on separate days, and the last reading of a bill shall be voted upon by the legislators.

> [!tip]- Majority required for approval  
> Each House of Congress shall, unless otherwise the Philippine Constitution or its laws provides, vote on the approval and passage of legislation through a **simple relative majority**- meaning, only a simple majority of the members present shall be necessary for the passage of a subject matter.
> 
> This is in contrast with some subject matters, such as the provision of tax exemption by law, which requires a *simple absolute majority*, or a simple majority of all the members of the Congress, whether present or absent.

> 
> Now, when it comes to the passage of legislations, a majority is defined as 50% +1. Meaning, in a measure with 260 Congresspeople present, a relative majority of 131 voting for its passage is necessary.
> 
> There is also no provision for a tie breaking vote vested in the Heads of each House of Congress. This is because such Heads are Congresspeople originating from their respective Houses. To vote for a tie breaking vote would mean that they would have voted twice for a subject matter.
> 
> If any, only matters involving the Commission on Appointments may have a tie-breaking vote by the Senate President, them being the *ex officio* Chairperson of the Commission with no voting power, except in cases of ties.

> [!note]- Author’s note: Tie-breaking votes  
> As stated above, there are no tie breaking votes in the legislative process of the Congress. This is in contrast with the United States of America, wherein the Senate President, being the concurrent Vice President of the Executive Department, may only cast their vote in case of a tie.

If the bill is approved in a House of Congress, it is sent to the other House of Congress for its introduction, deliberation, and approval- generally the same process as that of the originating House.

This process is repeated multiple times until both House of Congress agrees to the same version of a bill. Alternatively, a bicameral conference may be called upon to reconcile the versions of both House of Congress into a singular bill.

After both House of Congress approves to the same version, it is sent to the President for their approval. Three things may occur:
1. If the President signs it, it becomes a law.
2. If the President does not sign it, and does not send their objections to the bill (also known as veto) thirty days after receipt of a bill, it becomes a law.
3. If the President does not sign it, and returns their objections to the originating House of Congress, it does not become a law, *except* if both House of Congress, voting in a two-thirds majority separately, overrides the veto of the President, then it becomes a law.

Note that for revenue, appropriation, and tariff bills, the President may veto specific line items in the bill, but the passage of the entire bill will not be affected. This is in contrast to the veto of a regular bill, wherein its veto affects the passage of the bill in its entirety. **Line-item vetoes may still be overridden by the Congress**.

## Consistency of IRRs to the Law
Note that laws may vest a government agency to craft an *Implementing Rules and Regulations* for the proper execution of such law. These IRRs shall be consistent with the provisions of the law, and shall not extend beyond what is provided for by law.

Further, laws also take time to craft. It shall never be considered as a *speedrun* to pass as much laws in the shortest time possible. However, in special cases, such as when the President shall certify a measure as urgent in times of calamities or emergencies. Thus read:

> **ARTICLE VI SECTION 26(2)**. No bill passed by either House shall become a law unless it has passed three readings on separate days, and printed copies thereof in its final form have been distributed to its Members three days before its passage, ==except when the President certifies to the necessity of its immediate enactment to meet a public calamity or emergency==. Upon the last reading of a bill, no amendment thereto shall be allowed, and the vote thereon shall be taken immediately thereafter, and the yeas and nays entered in the Journal.  
> (Emphasis added)

## Special Notes on Taxation
Appropriation, revenue, or tariff bills shall originate exclusively in the House of Representatives. However, the Senate may propose amendments to the version approved by the House of Representatives.

- Note that an appropriation, revenue, or tariff bill **needs** to be approved and transmitted to the Senate before the latter may introduce amendments to it. Its mere introduction to the House of Representatives does not warrant the Senate to introduce a bill covering the above mentioned subject matters on its own.
- However, companion bills are allowed since it is sent to both the House of Representatives and the Senate concurrently. Companion bills are, in essence, bills with the same version. This is often done to speed up the legislative process especially if the subject matter of a bill is of public importance.
- Bills initially introduced in the Senate that seeks to substitute a bill originating and approved in the House of Representatives is also allowed. Because it has the same effect as if the Senate has amended the bill of the House of Representatives.
