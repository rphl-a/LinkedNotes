Generally, taxes may be categorized into three:
- Progressive, wherein high income earners are taxed more. The tax rate is directly proportional to a tax base.
- Regressive, wherein high income earners are taxed less. The tax rate is indirectly proportional to a tax base.
- Proportional, wherein the tax imposed is based on a fixed amount or rate regardless of income or wealth.

The Philippine Constitution encourages the Congress to evolve a progressive system of taxation, but not necessarily limited to progressive taxes. Also read: [[./TAX-01 - Principles of Taxation - Synthesis#Uniformity and Progressive System of Taxation|Evolving a Progressive System of Taxation]]
