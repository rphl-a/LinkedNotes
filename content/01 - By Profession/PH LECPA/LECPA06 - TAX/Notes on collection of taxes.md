In coercively collecting the tax due against a taxpayer, due process must still be adhered to:
- A Preliminary Collection is issued to the taxpayer.
- A Final Assessment before Seizure Letter is then issued to the taxpayer 10 days following the issuance of a Preliminary Collection.
- The BIR then issues a Warrant of Distraint or Levy if the tax due of the taxpayer exceeds PHP 100.00. It is issued 91 days after an assessment has become final, executory, and demandable.
- The BIR then conducts a research on the taxpayerâ€™s properties to determine which real properties to seize in order to satisfy the claim of the government (for tax levy)
- A Notice of Tax Lien or Notice of Levy is issued to the taxpayer.
	- A Tax Lien attaches to the property itself. It makes the property a priority claim for the government.
	- Meanwhile, a Tax Levy is the actual legal seizure of the property in favour of the government to satisfy tax debt. *Note that the term **tax levy** is also used when acquiring personal properties*.
- The levied property is then put into public auction 20 days after levy. The property is then sold to the highest bidder and absorbs the following tax deficiencies of the erring taxpayer (based on the amount paid by the bidder):
	- Tax due
	- Penalties and interest
	- Expenses of distraint/levy
	- Cost of selling properties
- However, if there are no bidders, the property acquired is forfeited in favour of the Philippine Republic.

The BIR issues a Warrant of Distraint or a Warrant of Levy again and again for as long as there are tax debts against the taxpayer.
