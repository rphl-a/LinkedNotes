A letter notice refers to a letter issued by the [[Bureau of Internal Revenue|Bureau of Internal Revenue]] notifying a taxpayer that significant discrepancies on filed returns by the taxpayer exist in their system.

It merely informs the taxpayer of discrepancies, but the taxpayer may nonetheless reconcile said transactions with the BIR within 5 days of receipt of such notice, and paid 30 days thereafter (with no penalties). If paid beyond the 30 day period, penalties start to occur.

Note that a letter notice is not a [[Letter of Authority|Letter of Authority]], nor is it an authority to conduct audit of the taxpayerâ€™s books. A Letter of Authority, once issued, also supersedes a Letter Notice, making the latter null and void.

Finally, payments of tax for line items contained in a letter notice still included in a letter of authority may be claimed as tax credits under the letter of authority.
