A letter notice notifies a taxpayer that *significant* discrepancies exist on the filed returns of a taxpayer when matched against the records within their system.

Based from its name, it merely informs the taxpayer of their discrepancies and gives them a chance to reconcile such transactions with the [[Bureau of Internal Revenue|Bureau of Internal Revenue]] within 5 days upon receipt of such notice. After reconciling and discussions, the taxpayer shall pay the tax due 30 days thereafter. *No penalties or interests are imposed during this 30-day period*.

A letter notice is **not** a [[Letter of Authority|Letter of Authority]], which grants the BIR the power to conduct tax audit of a taxpayerâ€™s books. The letter of authority also supersedes a letter notice, making the letter notice null and void.[^1]

[^1]: However, if payments were made by the taxpayer from the letter notice, and the assessment made during the actual tax audit process (i.e., assessment) still includes line-items that were already paid by such taxpayer, they may claim such amounts as a tax credit.
