Generally, the hierarchy of laws are as follow:
- The **basic law** is the supreme law of a country. Usually enacted by the people, it governs the conduct of government officials in a sovereign state and the rights of its citizens.
- **Treaties** are agreements entered into by a country with an external organization- oftentimes external ones- binding their state to the terms of an agreement. Basic laws often provide limitations and conditions on how a country can enter itself into a treaty.
- **Laws** are pieces of legislation usually enacted by a legislative authority of a state. They provide for the framework by which the government and the country operates.
- **Decisions of the courts** refer to the judgement made by courts over a particular issue or questions of law. The decision of the court also has the power to interpret the law, but in no way change or alter that law so as to create a new law.
- **Resolutions, regulations, and rules** refer to documents created by an agency to ensure execution and compliance to a law in accordance to procedures set thereon.

Following this hierarchy, treaties must be compatible to that of a stateâ€™s basic law. Similarly, laws and decisions of the courts shall be in consonance to that of the basic law.

Laws enacted by an agency also follows the concept of statutory jurisdiction. Meaning, if a legislative authority is granted the power to create laws within their scope of jurisdiction, then it may do so. *Say, in the University Student Government setup, laws enacted by the Congress takes precedence over all other Ordinances and Resolutions issued by College Student Governments and Program Councils because the University Student Government Congress has the highest statutory jurisdiction when it comes to creating laws, subject to certain provisions as may be provided under the USG Constitution.*
