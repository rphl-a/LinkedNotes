Dividends represent the distributed profits of a company to its owners (or shareholders).

## Tax Implications
The results of a [[Predominance Test|Predominance Test]] conducted in a corporation has the following implications to a dividend for [[Income Tax|Income Tax]] purposes:
- If $G_{PH}$ ≥ 50%, the ratio in predominance test is used to determine how much of the income is earned within the Philippines.
- If ${G_{PH}}$ < 50%, it is considered as wholly earned outside the Philippines.

Dividends from a resident foreign corporation received by a domestic corporation is classified as an *intercorporate dividend*. This type of dividend is exempt from tax if $G_{PH}$ ≥ 50% of the declaring resident foreign corporation.

However, it may also be exempted for income tax purposes when $G_{PH}$ < 50% if:
- There is at least 20% ownership of Filipinos on the foreign corporation;
- The ownership is held for at least two years; and
- Dividends are fully utilized before the end of the following year.
