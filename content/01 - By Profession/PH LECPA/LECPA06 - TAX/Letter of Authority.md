A letter of authority grants the [[./Bureau of Internal Revenue|Bureau of Internal Revenue]] to conduct tax audits of a taxpayer‚Äôs books for national taxes that regularly occur in the ordinary course of their business.[^1] This is the first and essential step in the assessment process.

Generally, a taxpayer may only be subject to tax audit once per taxable year, and be issued to a name of one taxpayer only. However, there are exceptions to this rule: **==(RIOV[^2])==**
- Requests for reinvestigation
- Irregularities or fraud
- Obtain information, duly exercised by the Commissioner, either through a [[./Subpoena duces tecum|Subpoena duces tecum]] or a [[./Subpoena ad testificandum|Subpoena ad testificandum]].
- Verifying withholding tax obligations or capital gains tax

A letter of authority is valid if: ==**(PRISM-120)**==
1. **PR**inted under [[./eLAMS|eLAMS]];  
2. **I**dentifies what type of tax is covered being subjected to tax audit;  
3. **S**erved to the taxpayer 30 days from the date indicated in the letter;[^3]
4. **M**ultiple times served if under exception list (see above).
5. **120** days validity period once served to the taxpayer. May be revalidated once for micro, small, and medium taxpayers, and twice for large taxpayers.

Without a letter of authority, a tax audit may not occur for it would be a violation of the taxpayer‚Äôs right to [[./PH Bill of Rights - Right to due process and equal protection of law#Due Process|due process]].
