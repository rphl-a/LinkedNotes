Tax, being legislative by nature, are governed by the provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 (as amended) in the case of national taxes, and various ordinances through the Local Government Code of 1991 (as amended) in the case of local taxes.

## Definitions of Taxation
Taxation may be defined in any of the three definitions: (a) as an inherent power of the State; (b) as a process of levying tax; or (c) as a mode of allocating government burden to the people (i.e., cost allocation).

Tax is a voluntary requirement. The executive merely collects what is due from the citizens.
### As an Inherent Power of the State
Inherent powers refer to the powers vested in a State. Upon the creation of a state, it is generally accepted that these inherent powers will exist even if it is not provided for under its constitution or basic law.

There are three inherent powers of the state, namely:
- The power to **tax**, which compels the citizens of a State to contribute to the nation often in the form of monies.
- The power to **police**, which enforces the law and protects the well-being of the people. It is a form of regulating the freedom granted by the government to its citizen, thus ensuring peace and order in the society.
- The power of **eminent domain**, which acquires private properties by the State to re-purpose it for public use.

The people, through its constitution, may provide for the conditions and restrictions on how these powers are to be exercised by a government. These three powers are necessary attributes to sovereignty and exists independently of the basic law. Further, they are often legislative by nature. Meaning, it is necessary that a legislative authority provides law for the proper exercise of these powers.

These powers also interferes with private rights and properties, but shall be used for public purposes. It also presupposes an equivalent compensation affected by the exercise of such power, whether it be directly, indirectly, or remote.

And, being legislative by nature, these powers may be exercised by local government units if the Congress provides such law granting the same.

#### Differences
There are certain differences between the three inherent powers of the State.

| Characteristic                        | Taxation                                            | Police Power                                                                                | Eminent Domain                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Exercising authority                  | Government                                          | Government                                                                                  | Government or private entities                                                     |
| Persons affected                      | Community of class of individuals                   | Community or class of individuals                                                           | Operates on the owner of the property                                              |

| Effect of transfer of property rights | Money paid as taxes becomes part of the public fund | There is no transfer of title, at most there is restraint on the injurious use of property. | There is transfer of right to property whether it be of ownership or lesser right. |

We have the first table, which is very self-explanatory.

| Characteristic          | Taxation                                         | Police Power                                                        | Eminent Domain                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Necessity of Delegation | Delegation is not necessary since it is inherent | There must be delegation before local governments could exercise it | There must be due delegation before local government or private party may exercise it |

The second table provides for how these powers may be delegated by the government, usually the highest one (in the case of the Philippines, the National Government) to the Local Government Units. Note that for both police and eminent domain powers, it must be delegated to the proper entities before its exercise may be effected. This is a restriction provided under the Philippine Constitution.

However, for taxation, *delegation is not necessary*.

> Note that the term used is *not necessary*. While the Philippine Constitution provides for methods by which the power of taxation may be delegated by the Congress to the various agencies of the government, its non-delegation would still render the power to tax *operative*.
> 
> Also note that the power to tax may be delegated to other entities as provided for under the Philippine Constitution. These entities are: (a) the President; (b) Local Government Units; and (c) through the exercise of direct democracy.

And then we have the third table… *Since the primary subject of this matter is taxation, we give emphasis on the power to tax*.

The amount imposed in taxes is unlimited by nature. Meaning, the Congress (or the Local Government Units upon delegation by the Congress) may impose whatever amount as a form of tax to the people. There is no minimum amount (or floor) required to tax, and likewise, there is no maximum amount acting as a ceiling for tax collections. However, note that *the power to tax also includes the power to destroy*. Meaning, this power must be exercised responsibly and with caution to minimize injury to the proprietary rights of a taxpayer.[^1]

> On Police Power’s amount of imposition: Licensing, such as driver’s license and professional licenses, is a police power since it involves the regulation of an expertise or profession in our country, essential to ensure compliance to current laws and regulations.

> [!note]- Author’s note: Power to tax also includes…  
> The power to tax also includes the power to destroy. However, this does not mean that the power to destroy is the only power included in the power to tax.

> Tax exemption, or the power to exempt certain objects from being taxed, is also included in the power to tax.

Taxation is the most important of the three inherent powers of the state because without taxation, the other two powers would not come into fruition. There would be no funding for the police agency, and there would be no compensation given to those persons whose properties are acquired for public purpose.

However, the power to tax is inferior to the non-impairment clause of the Philippine Constitution. The non-impairment clause refer to those obligations and contracts, which read:

> **ARTICLE III SECTION 10**. No law impairing the obligations of contracts shall be passed.

A contract is impaired if the terms and conditions of a contract is changed by law or by a party without the consent of the other, thereby weaking the position or rights of the latter. In simpler terms, tax cannot disturb the operation of a contract between two parties by a mere taxing statute.[^2]

Lastly, the power of taxation is both constitutionally and inherently limited. Also see: [[Limitations of Taxation|Limitations of Taxation]]
### As a Process
Taxation as a process refers to the levying and assessment of tax.
- Taxes are levied/imposed through the power of the Congress.
- Taxes are assessed through the powers vested to an agency by the Congress.

Therefore, the power to tax is a power vested in the Congress. Meaning, there must be a law provided for by the Congress for an object be subject to tax- the impact of taxation.

Also see: [[The Legislative Process - Philippine Congress|The Legislative Process - Philippine Congress]]

The Congress may also vest the power to tax to the Local Government Units through its legislative authorities- the *Sandiganbayan*.

The Congress vests the power to administer tax to an agency under the Executive Department. Or, in the case of Local Government Units, to an agency under the executive authority of that unit. These agencies assess and collect tax in accordance to enacted laws and ordinances.

> Note that the issuance of rules and regulations of an agency under an executive authority is a power vested by the Congress or of a legislative authority. Therefore, these issuance are also administrative (or executive) by nature.

> [!question]- Hypothetical: Can the Congress vest the power to tax to any other agency of the Philippine Government other than that of an LGU?  
> Personally, I think that this may be possible. Because the provision that the Congress may vest the power to LGUs, and the accrued revenues exclusive to them, is a power granted by the Philippine Constitution to the LGUs.
> 
> Meaning, it is not a limitation in of itself. The Congress, if so desired, may mandate the Commission on Audit the power to enact tax laws (even though it sounds crazy). However, the Congress, being the source of that vested power for that agency, may revoke the same at any time through the passage of a law repealing the same. Also, it would violate the Doctrine of Separation of Powers between these agencies.
> 
> *But still… No one in their right mind would do this, right? Right??!*

### As a Mode of Cost Allocation
Taxation may also be defined as a mode of cost allocation of the Philippine government, or the imposition of burden through taxation, to the people. This is also the most practical definition of taxation.

In allocating costs incurred by the government, there are two ways that the government considers in its exercise of tax power:
1. **Benefits Received Theory**, wherein the receipt of benefit is directly proportional to the taxes paid to the government. The benefits received by a person is based on the principle of fairness and is presumed conclusively, meaning that for as long as you are within the territories under the sovereignty of the Philippine government, regardless of *actual* benefits received, then it is presumed that you have received a benefit nonetheless. This means that a defence that a person should not pay their taxes for the reason of not being able to experience benefits made by the government is not valid.
2. **Ability To Pay Theory**, wherein the payment of taxes by the taxpayer is relative to their capacity to support the government. Meaning, those who have more should be taxed more, and vice versa. There are two principles for ability to pay, and are: (a) vertical equity, which correlates the taxpayer’s ability to pay with their tax base; and (b) horizontal equity, which requires the consideration of the particular circumstance of the taxpayer (or similarly situated individuals should face similar tax burdens.

> [!note]- Author’s note  
> For the principles for the ability to pay theory, the vertical axis may refer to one’s wealth while the horizontal axis may refer to one’s circumstances.
