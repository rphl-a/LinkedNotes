Secondary purposes may stem from the desire and the nature of the Philippine government being primarily organized for public purpose, such as regulation, compensation, and promotion of economic and social stability.

## Sources of Tax Laws
Tax laws may originate from any of the following sources:
- **Constitution**, which is the supreme law of the land.
- **Statutes**, which is enacted by a legislative authority and may involve the following categories:
	- Republic Acts, under the 1987 Constitution (current).
	- Presidential Decrees (Executive)[^2] and Batas Pambansa (Legislative), under the 1973 Constitution.
	- Acts of Congress, under the 1902 Constitution.
- **Executive Orders** (see comment below)
- **Tax Treaties and Conventions**
- **Administrative Issuances, such as Revenue Regulations, or BIR Rulings**
	- Revenue regulations interprets or explains tax laws, and shall have the force of law (but not greater to the governing statute- the National Internal Revenue Code).
	- BIR Rulings answer inquiries between a taxpayer and the BIR. It does not have the force of law. At best, it is binding to only the parties mentioned in the Ruling.
- **Judicial Decisions**[^3]
- **Local Ordinances**

> [!danger]- Vague: on Executive Orders as a source of tax law (UNRESOLVED)  
> Executive Orders as a source of tax laws is a debatable classification. Executive Orders are issuances made by the President of the Philippine Republic and generally only affects the Executive Department, or at least under the 1987 Philippine Constitution. 
> 
> The 1986 Freedom Constitution allowed the President to continue exercising legislative power from the 1973 Constitution (under Marcos administration). If any, and in this context, the power of an Executive Order having the force of law is limited to those granted to the powers of the President as conferred to them by the Philippine Constitution and its offspring laws, such as those for tariff rates, import and export quotas, tonnage and wharfage dues, and such other duties and imposts as may be provided by law. 
> 
> But then again, the website of BIR itself does not include Executive Orders as a source of tax law. See here: [Guide to Philippine Tax Law Research](https://www.bir.gov.ph/guide-to-PH-tax-law-research)

> Related to this opinion: [[Tax Legislative powers|Tax Legislative powers]]

> [!danger]- Vague: on the *fewest* source of tax laws being PDs (UNRESOLVED)  
> It was also mentioned in the recorded material that the fewest source of tax laws are Presidential Decrees. [However, upon reviewing and cross-checking with the website of BIR](https://www.bir.gov.ph/tax-guide-PH-taxation), ==there are no Presidential Decrees still in effect that affect tax laws==.
> 
> If any, the fewest source of tax laws are Executive Orders, or, actually, an Executive Order: Executive Order No. 226 s. 1987 (under the operation of current 1987 Constitution). However, this, too, was repealed by succeeding Republic Acts.
> 
> It is possible that at the time that the question on the *fewest source of tax laws* appeared in the LECPA still had some Presidential Decrees affecting tax laws.

> Further research is required.

## Scope of Taxation (CUPS)
The power to tax is regarded as the **most absolute** of all the powers of the government. It also has the broadest scope of all the powers because without conditions, it is considered as comprehensive, unlimited, plenary, and supreme.
- It is ***c**omprehensive* because it covers all persons, activities, businesses, professions, rights, and privileges.
- It is ***u**nlimited* because the only limitation is the responsibility of the legislature which imposes tax to the constituents who pay it.
- It is ***p**lenary* because it is a not incomplete.
- It is ***s**upreme* because whatever subject may be selected to pay the tax.

The power to tax is only limited by the inherent and constitutional limitations provided for under the Philippine Constitution, and the sole principal check on its abuse rests on the responsibility of the legislators to their constituents.[^4] [^5]

## Situs of Taxation
The situs of taxation refers to the location of the object of taxation. The place of the object is where the tax is imposed. Note that in Financial Reporting, the concept of situs do not apply, except for the disclosure of the various operating segments of the company (i.e., its geographical area).

This is in consonance with the inherent limitation of tax being territorial by nature. Meaning, tax paid to the taxing authority shall only be within the scope or jurisdiction of said taxing authority.

> This concept may also be applied to taxes imposed by Local Government Units. LGUs cannot impose a tax outside their statutory jurisdiction. As an example, the City of Dasmariñas cannot impose taxes for objects whose situs falls on Imus, Cavite.

Generally, the situs of taxation are as follow:
1. The residence of the taxpayer
2. The citizenship of the taxpayer
3. The place of the object to tax

> Essentially, the situs of a tax object answers the question *where*, then *who*.

## Principles of a Sound Tax System
There are three principles of a sound tax system as formulated by [[Adam Smith|Adam Smith]]- a well-known economist and widely regarded as the father of modern economics- in their book *Wealth of Nations*.

1. *Fiscal Adequacy*. Taxes collected by the government shall be sufficient to meet the demand for public expenditures.
2. *Administrative Feasibility*. Tax shall be capable of convenient, just, and effective administration.
3. *Theoretical Justice*. Tax is imposed with equity and certainty, and must consider the taxpayer’s ability to pay and benefits received. This is consonance with the progressive system of taxation, which in itself is a Constitutional Limitation.

Various tax rules may also result to effects in accordance with consumer choice theory, such as:
- Income effect, which describes how a change in consumer income impacts consumption. It generally makes people more economically efficient.
- Substitution effect, which describes how a change in price of goods reallocates resources between products. It generally makes people more economically inefficient.

[^2]: Presidential Decrees, despite being issued by an Executive authority, has the force of a legislation. As provided for under the Philippine Official Gazette: *Presidential Decrees were an innovation made by President Ferdinand E. Marcos with the proclamation of Martial Law. They served to arrogate unto the Chief Executive the [law-making] powers of Congress. Only President Marcos issued Presidential Decrees. In the Freedom Constitution of 1986, President Corazon C. Aquino recognized the validity of existing Presidential Decrees unless otherwise repealed.*
