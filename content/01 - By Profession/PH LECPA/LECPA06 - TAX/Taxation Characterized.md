## Purpose of Taxation
The primary purpose of taxation is to raise revenues for the Philippine government. Secondary purposes may stem from the desire and the nature of the Philippine government being primarily organized for public purpose, such as regulation, compensation, and promotion of economic and social stability.
## Scope of Taxation (CUPS)
The power to tax is regarded as comprehensive, unlimited, plenary, and supreme.
- It is ***c**omprehensive* because it covers all persons, activities, businesses, professions, rights, and privileges.
- It is ***u**nlimited* because the only limitation is the responsibility of the legislature which imposes tax to the constituents who pay it.
- It is ***p**lenary* because it is a not incomplete.
- It is ***s**upreme* because whatever subject may be selected to pay the tax.

The power to tax is only limited by the inherent and constitutional limitations provided for under the Philippine Constitution, and the sole principal check on its abuse rests on the responsibility of the legislators to their constituents.[^1] [^2]

## Situs of Taxation
The situs of taxation refers to the location of the object of taxation. The place of the object is where the tax is imposed. Note that in Financial Reporting, the concept of situs do not apply, except for the disclosure of the various operating segments of the company (i.e., its geographical area).

This is in consonance with the inherent limitation of tax being territorial by nature. Meaning, tax paid to the taxing authority shall only be within the scope or jurisdiction of said taxing authority.

> This concept may also be applied to taxes imposed by Local Government Units. LGUs cannot impose a tax outside their statutory jurisdiction. As an example, the City of Dasmariñas cannot impose taxes for objects whose situs falls on Imus, Cavite.

Generally, the situs of taxation are as follow:
1. The residence of the taxpayer
2. The citizenship of the taxpayer
3. The place of the object to tax

> Essentially, the situs of a tax object answers the question *where*, then *who*.

## Principles of a Sound Tax System
There are three principles of a sound tax system as formulated by [Adam Smith](Adam%20Smith.md)- a well-known economist and widely regarded as the father of modern economics- in their book *Wealth of Nations*.

1. *Fiscal Adequacy*. Taxes collected by the government shall be sufficient to meet the demand for public expenditures.
2. *Administrative Feasibility*. Tax shall be capable of convenient, just, and effective administration.
3. *Theoretical Justice*. Tax is imposed with equity and certainty, and must consider the taxpayer’s ability to pay and benefits received. This is consonance with the progressive system of taxation, which in itself is a Constitutional Limitation.

Various tax rules may also result to effects in accordance with consumer choice theory, such as:
- Income effect, which describes how a change in consumer income impacts consumption. It generally makes people more economically efficient.
- Substitution effect, which describes how a change in price of goods reallocates resources between products. It generally makes people more economically inefficient.
