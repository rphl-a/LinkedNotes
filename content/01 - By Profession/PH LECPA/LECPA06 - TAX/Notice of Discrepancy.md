A notice of discrepancy informs the taxpayer that, as a result of audit, discrepancies exist between the tax paid and tax due computed by the BIR. Upon the issuance of such notice, the taxpayer and the BIR schedules a **Discussion of Discrepancy** within a period of 5 days, up to a maximum of 30 days, allowing the taxpayer to explain their side of the story and provide relevant evidence to support such claims.

It is formerly known as a Notice of Informal Conference.
