When we say legislative powers, we refer to the power of an authority to create laws as provided for under the basic law.

In the Philippines, there are generally two authorities which can exercise legislative powers:
- **The Congress** which has the plenary power of taxation, and may delegate the same to the President and the Local Government Units within the country.
	- *The President* has the power to impose tariff rates, import and export quotas, tonnage and wharfage dues, and other duties and imposts as may be provided by law. They may also be provided with emergency powers in times of war or national emergencies. Note that this power may be limited and revoked by the Congress.
	- *The Local Government Units* has the power to impose taxes, fees, and charges in accordance with the conditions provided for by law. Note that the Philippine Constitution calls for the Congress to vest this power to Local Government Units and thus cannot be revoked.
- **The People**, through the exercise of their power for [[Initiative and Referendum|Initiative and Referendum]]. These powers allow people to propose and amend laws, and accept or reject laws passed by a legislative authority. This power is an inherent right of the people, being vested by the Philippine Constitution. The Congress provides for the system and conditions for such power.
