Escapes from taxation refers to the decrease (or non-payment) of tax to a taxing agency. They may be legal or illegal based on the method used. It may also have detrimental effects to the ability of the government to collect tax.

## No reduction in government revenue
The following are escapes from taxation that will not result to a loss in government revenue:
- **Shifting** refers to the transfer of tax burden from the statutory taxpayer to another.
- **Capitalization** refers to the shouldering of tax burden to the buyers.
- **Transformation** refers to the shouldering of tax by the manufacturers. It also has the side effect of improving the business operations (by making it more efficient (through lowered costs)).

## Results to reduction in government revenue
The following are escapes from taxation that will result to a loss in government revenue:
- **Tax evasion, or tax dodging**, refers to the criminal act of non-payment of taxes.
- **Tax avoidance, or tax minimization, tax planning**, refers to the reduction of taxes paid through legal means. Examples include availing of provisions in the Tax Code to reduce the effect of tax imposed, such as in the case of Donor’s Tax exemption threshold of P250,000. *Note that offsetting losses and income from subsidiaries are not allowed in the Philippines*.

**Tax exemption** refers to the explicit exemption of the Philippine Government the payment of tax by the taxpayers. It is legislative by nature, and requires the concurrence of an absolute simple majority of each House of Congress for the passage of such law. Also see: [[The Legislative Process - Philippine Congress|The Legislative Process - Philippine Congress]].

### Amnesty and Condonation
In addition to the abovementioned examples, the following also results to a reduction in government revenue borne as a result of forgone revenue through forgiveness of the government.
- **Tax Amnesty**. It refers to the pardon provided to qualified taxpayers, intentionally overlooking the guilt of tax evasion or violation of tax laws. It condones criminal, civil, and administrative liabilities attached to such crime, which in effect waives the government’s right to collect what is due. This is used to make someone part of the society again in a clean slate.
- **Tax Condonation**. It refers to the condonation of civil penalties relating to violation of tax laws. It does not absolve an individual from any civil or administrative liabilities attached thereto, and only applies proactively. This is in contrast with tax amnesties, which applies retroactively.

## Compromise and Abatement
A compromise refers when an agreement between the taxpayer and the [[Bureau of Internal Revenue|Bureau of Internal Revenue]] is reached, resulting to the settlement of the taxpayer’s liability for less than the settled amount. A compromise can only be permitted under these two conditions:
1. **Compromise**: If there is doubt as to the validity of the assessment, and the minimum settlement is 10% of the basic tax due; or
2. **Abatement/Cancellation**: If the taxpayer faces financial incapacity, and the minimum settlement is 40% of the basic tax due.

The following entities also have the following jurisdiction based on the basic tax due amount by the taxpayer raised for compromise:

| Basic Tax Due        | Agency Concerned           |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 500,000 and below    | Regional Evaluation Board  |
| 500,001 to 1,000,000 | Office of the Commissioner |
| 1,000,001 and above  | National Evaluation Board  |

If the settlement paid by the taxpayer is less than what is prescribed by law, the Commissioner on Internal Revenue may approve such settlement nonetheless.

Note that a jeopardy assessment refers to a tax assessment made without the benefit of a complete or partial audit by an authorized revenue officer. This is primarily used if there is doubt as to the validity of the assessment and the taxpayer wants to enter into a compromise.
