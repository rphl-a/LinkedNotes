Taxation is an inherent power vested in the state and is primarily legislative by nature. It is imperative that an individual grasp understanding of the structure of the Philippine Government to fully understand how and what taxes are imposed by the various agencies of the government.

## Introduction to The Philippine Constitution
The 1987 Philippine Constitution is the supreme law of the land governing the function of the government and the rights of its citizens. It encapsulates the will of the people, this being a charter enacted by the people of the Philippines.

The Philippine Constitution provided for the creation of three co-equal departments of the National Government, the Local Governments, and the independent Constitutional Commissions.

### The Philippine Government
The Philippines is a democratic and republican state. It is governed by a government called The Philippine Government, or sometimes referred to as the National Government, and the Local Governments over the various administrative divisions that exist in the Philippines.

The National Government is divided into three co-equal departments. As co-equal departments, each agency has their own checks and balances over its own agency and the others. They are:
- The Legislative Department, also known as the Congress, is divided into two House of Congress, namely the Senate and the House of Representatives. They make laws for the welfare of the public.
- The Executive Department, or the Executive Branch, is a component of the government tasked with executing the provisions of the Philippine Constitution and its laws. Also read: [[../../../00 - General Notes/Inbox/EO 292 s. 1987/index|Administrative Code of 1987 (not yet done)]]
- The Judicial Department, reigned by the Supreme Court and such other lower courts as may be provided by law, is tasked with settling controversies and interpretations of the law (or Judicial Review)

Adhering to the Doctrine of Separation of Powers, each department has distinct and non-overlapping functions over one another.

> As an example, the Legislative Department creates laws for the country. They may also impeach erring public officers in the Executive or Judicial Department upon violation of the Philippine Constitution and its laws.
> 
> The Executive Department faithfully executes all laws enacted by the Congress. Likewise, it may also veto proposed laws sent by the Congress through the powers vested in the President.
> 
> The Judicial Department reviews the constitutionality and validity of laws enacted by the Congress and directives issued by the Executive Department. Likewise, they are composed of justices appointed by the President as recommended by the Judicial and Bar Council (JBC).

Meanwhile, the Local Government is divided into various administrative subdivisions. These administrative subdivisions both have legislative and executive authorities, which is similar to how the Legislative and Executive Departments of the National Government operates. It may be divided into the following administrative divisions, namely (and generally):
- Regions. However, regions are merely used to organize the provision of services by the National Government. The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao is the only region in the Philippines that has a regional government.
- Provinces. Its executive authority emanates from the Governor and its legislative authority emanates from the Provincial Council (or *Sangguniang Panlalawigan*).
- Municipalities. Its executive authority emanates from the Mayor and its legislative authority emanates from the Municipal/City Council (or *Sangguniang Panlungsod*).
- Barangays. Its executive authority emanates from the Barangay Captain and its legislative authority emanates from the Barangay Coincol (or *Sangguniang Barangay*)

The first- and second-level courts mimic the geographical organization of the country. First-level courts include the Metropolitan Trial Courts (MeTC), Municipal Trial Courts (MTC), Municipal Trial Courts in Cities (MTCC), and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts (MCTC), while the second-level court include the Regional Trial Court.

The third-level court is the Court of Appeals. Other courts directly one level lower to the Supreme Court include the Sandiganbayan and the Court of Tax Appeals.

> [!note]- Office of the Ombudsman
> The Office of the Ombudsman is an agency created under Article XI of the Philippine Constitution (Accountability of Public Officers). It investigates and prosecutes public officials. Separate from the Judicial Department.

### The Constitutional Commissions
There are three independent Constitutional Commissions organized under the operation of the Philippine Constitution. Namely:
- The Civil Service Commission, which oversees the integrity of government actions and processes.
- The Commission on Audit, which examines, audits, and settles all accounts and expenditures of the government.
- The Commission on Elections, which oversees the conduct of elections, plebiscite, initiative, referendum, and recall.

> [!tip]- The necessity of being independent
> It is necessary that these agencies be independent from the Philippine Government because the function of the former is often correlated as political by nature, so as to ensure that the functions enshrined upon these commissions be executed faithfully.
> 
> Imagine if these agencies were to be attached to a particular agency of the Philippine Government. Say, the Executive Department, which is political by nature:
> 
> - The functions of the government will be more susceptible to inaction, inefficiencies, and dishonesty.
> - The revenues and expenditures of the Philippine government will be more prone to corruption and misuse.
> - The results of an election will be at a higher risk of being fraudulent and manipulated to ensure that the officials that the officers of the commission supports win.

## Taxation Defined and Characterized
Tax, being legislative by nature, are governed by the provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 (as amended) in the case of national taxes, and various ordinances through the Local Government Code of 1991 (as amended) in the case of local taxes.

### Definitions of Taxation
Taxation may be defined in any of the three definitions: (a) as an inherent power of the State; (b) as a process of levying tax; or (c) as a mode of allocating government burden to the people (i.e., cost allocation).

#### As an Inherent Power of the State
Inherent powers refer to the powers vested in a State. Upon the creation of a state, it is generally accepted that these inherent powers will exist even if it is not provided for under its constitution or basic law.

There are three inherent powers of the state, namely:
- The power to **tax**, which compels the citizens of a State to contribute to the nation often in the form of monies.
- The power to **police**, which enforces the law and protects the well-being of the people. It is a form of regulating the freedom granted by the government to its citizen, thus ensuring peace and order in the society.
- The power of **eminent domain**, which acquires private properties by the State to re-purpose it for public use.

The people, through its constitution, may provide for the conditions and restrictions on how these powers are to be exercised by a government. These three powers are necessary attributes to sovereignty and exists independently of the basic law. Further, they are often legislative by nature. Meaning, it is necessary that a legislative authority provides law for the proper exercise of these powers.

These powers also interferes with private rights and properties, but shall be used for public purposes. It also presupposes an equivalent compensation affected by the exercise of such power, whether it be directly, indirectly, or remote.

And, being legislative by nature, these powers may be exercised by local government units if the Congress provides such law granting the same.

##### Differences
There are certain differences between the three inherent powers of the State.

| Characteristic                        | Taxation                                            | Police Power                                                                                | Eminent Domain                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Exercising authority                  | Government                                          | Government                                                                                  | Government or private entities                                                     |
| Persons affected                      | Community of class of individuals                   | Community or class of individuals                                                           | Operates on the owner of the property                                              |
| Purpose                               | Revenue and support of the government               | Protection of well-being of the people                                                      | Property is taken for public use                                                   |
| Effect of transfer of property rights | Money paid as taxes becomes part of the public fund | There is no transfer of title, at most there is restraint on the injurious use of property. | There is transfer of right to property whether it be of ownership or lesser right. |

We have the first table, which is very self-explanatory.

| Characteristic          | Taxation                                         | Police Power                                                        | Eminent Domain                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Necessity of Delegation | Delegation is not necessary since it is inherent | There must be delegation before local governments could exercise it | There must be due delegation before local government or private party may exercise it |

The second table provides for how these powers may be delegated by the government, usually the highest one (in the case of the Philippines, the National Government) to the Local Government Units. Note that for both police and eminent domain powers, it must be delegated to the proper entities before its exercise may be effected. This is a restriction provided under the Philippine Constitution.

However, for taxation, *delegation is not necessary*.

> Note that the term used is *not necessary*. While the Philippine Constitution provides for methods by which the power of taxation may be delegated by the Congress to the various agencies of the government, its non-delegation would still render the power to tax *operative*.

| Characteristic                     | Taxation                                   | Police Power                                       | Eminent Domain                                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Amount of Imposition               | Unlimited                                  | Sufficient to cover the costs of regulation        | No imposition; the owner is paid the fair market value of their property |
| Importance                         | Most important of the three                | Most superior                                      |                                                                          |
| Relationship with the Constitution | Inferior to the *Non-impairment clause*    | Superior to the Non-impairment clause              | Superior and may override the Non-impairment clause                      |
| Limitation                         | Constitutionally and inherently restricted | Public interest and the requirement of due process | Public purpose and just compensation                                     |

And then we have the third table… *Since the primary subject of this matter is taxation, we give emphasis on the power to tax*.

The amount imposed in taxes is unlimited by nature. Meaning, the Congress (or the Local Government Units upon delegation by the Congress) may impose whatever amount as a form of tax to the people. There is no minimum amount (or floor) required to tax, and likewise, there is no maximum amount acting as a ceiling for tax collections. However, note that *the power to tax also includes the power to destroy*. Meaning, this power must be exercised responsibly and with caution to minimize injury to the proprietary rights of a taxpayer.[^1]

> On Police Power’s amount of imposition: Licensing, such as driver’s license and professional licenses, is a police power since it involves the regulation of an expertise or profession in our country, essential to ensure compliance to current laws and regulations.

#### As a Process
Taxation as a process refers to the levying and assessment of tax.
- Taxes are levied/imposed through the power of the Congress.
- Taxes are assessed through the powers vested to an agency by the Congress.

Therefore, the power to tax is a power vested in the Congress. Meaning, there must be a law provided for by the Congress for an object be subject to tax- the impact of taxation.

Also see: [[./The Legislative Process - Philippine Congress|The Legislative Process - Philippine Congress]]

The Congress may also vest the power to tax to the Local Government Units through its legislative authorities- the *Sandiganbayan*.

The Congress vests the power to administer tax to an agency under the Executive Department. Or, in the case of Local Government Units, to an agency under the executive authority of that unit. These agencies assess and collect tax in accordance to enacted laws and ordinances.

> Note that the issuance of rules and regulations of an agency under an executive authority is a power vested by the Congress or of a legislative authority. Therefore, these issuance are also administrative (or executive) by nature.

>[!question]- Hypothetical: Can the Congress vest the power to tax to any other agency of the Philippine Government other than that of an LGU?
>Personally, I think that this may be possible. Because the provision that the Congress may vest the power to LGUs, and the accrued revenues exclusive to them, is a power granted by the Philippine Constitution to the LGUs.
>
>Meaning, it is not a limitation in of itself. The Congress, if so desired, may mandate the Commission on Audit the power to enact tax laws (even though it sounds crazy). However, the Congress, being the source of that vested power for that agency, may revoke the same at any time through the passage of a law repealing the same. Also, it would violate the Doctrine of Separation of Powers between these agencies.

>*But still… No one in their right mind would do this, right? Right??!*

### Scope of Taxation (CUPS)
The power to tax is regarded as comprehensive, unlimited, plenary, and supreme.
- It is ***c**omprehensive* because it covers all persons, activities, businesses, professions, rights, and privileges.
- It is ***u**nlimited* because the only limitation is the responsibility of the legislature which imposes tax to the constituents who pay it.
- It is ***p**lenary* because it is a not incomplete.
- It is ***s**upreme* because whatever subject may be selected to pay the tax.

The power to tax is only limited by the inherent and constitutional limitations provided for under the Philippine Constitution, and the sole principal check on its abuse rests on the responsibility of the legislators to their constituents.[^2] [^3]

Tax is a voluntary requirement. The executive merely collects what is due from the citizens.
