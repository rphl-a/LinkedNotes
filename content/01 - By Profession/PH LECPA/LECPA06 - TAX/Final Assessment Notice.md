A final assessment notice is issued after the reply of the taxpayer to the PAN or upon the lapse of the 15 days period. The FAN, sometimes referred to as a *Formal Letter of Demand* (or in some RDOs, *Assessment Notice - Final Letter of Demand*), is delivered or sent by registered mail or by delivery and imposes the taxpayer to pay the assessed tax.

A FAN is considered valid if it is issued within the prescriptive period (i.e., 3 years from deadline or filing date, or 10 years upon discovery of non-filing or fraudulent return) and contain:
- Discrepancy information
- Facts and legal basis
- Demand for payment against the taxpayer.

The computation for the assessed tax due follows the 365[^1] day period in a year are as follow:
- `Basic tax due`
- + [[./Surcharge on tax due|25% or 50% Surcharge (tax due)]]
- + `12% annual interest (tax due)`
- = `Total tax due by taxpayer`[^2]

An additional `12% delinquent annual interest` is imposed to a taxpayer against their total tax due (i.e., inclusive of any surcharges and initial interests) for every delayed day of the total tax due. Non-payment of the assessed tax due by the BIR may give rise to a civil or criminal liabilities, or both, against a taxpayer.[^3]

The taxpayer shall have **30 days** after receipt of a FAN to file for the below mentioned motions, and the BIR shall reply to such motion within a period of 180 days:  
	1. *Motion for Reinvestigation*, if additional pieces of evidence will be submitted to the BIR within 60 days after filing this motion; or  
	2. *Motion for reconsideration*, if disputes are from the legal facts or issues provided by the BIR.

[^1]: 366 if it is a leap year. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.
[^2]: The total tax due of a taxpayer is the amount based for negotiating a compromise with the BIR. Note that for compromises (10%), it can be availed even after administrative finality has been rendered or if judicial cases is ongoing (but not final). However, for doubtful validity (40%), it can only be availed during the administrative remedies stage.
[^3]: The BIR may still file a judicial action against a taxpayer even if disputes between them are still ongoing.
