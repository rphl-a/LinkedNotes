Double Taxation refers to the act of taxing the same tax object twice, for the same period, nature, and tax authority.
- If the same tax object is taxed twice, and has all the secondary elements of double taxation, then it is considered as *direct double taxation*.
- If the same tax object is taxed twice, but only has some of the secondary elements of double taxation, then it is considered as *indirect double taxation*.

Note that under the [[Limitations of Taxation|Limitations of Taxation]], double taxation is not *expressly prohibited*. However, direct double taxation is generally considered as illegal in the Philippines based on the following grounds:
1. The tax system should be equitable and uniform.
2. The Supreme Court has ruled that *obnoxious double taxation* (or direct double taxation) is prohibited.

There are remedies for direct double taxation, including:
1. Tax credits. Taxpayers may avail themselves of tax credits to avoid the effects of direct double taxation.
2. Reciprocity, Treaties, and Agreements with Foreign Governments. The Philippine Government may enter into treaties and agreements to reduce the effect of direct double taxation. Examples include *Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAA)*.
