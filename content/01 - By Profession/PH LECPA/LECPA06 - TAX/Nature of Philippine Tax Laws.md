Laws in the Philippines may be classified into three: civil laws, criminal laws, and political laws.
- **Civil law** deals with the behaviour and conduct of citizens in the country. Non-compliance to civil laws may result to the imposition of civil or administrative sanctions.
- **Political law** pertains to laws involving the conduct of officers in the Philippine government, such as the establishment of government agencies, the code of conduct for government officers, and the like.
- **Criminal law** involves the punishment of offenses against the State. It may result to the imposition of civil, administrative, and criminal sanctions.

Tax laws are civil in nature and character. It remains in effect even in times of war. Penalties may also be imposed for violation of tax laws, such as tax evasion or fraudulent filing of tax returns, which results to imprisonment, or delayed filing, which results to surcharges.

Finally, tax laws are generally prospective (or forward-looking) by nature. Retroactivity effect for tax laws are generally not considered unless otherwise provided for by law.

> [!error]- Potential error: Recorded material, laws cannot be *ex post facto* laws  
> The recorded material stated that laws may not be *ex post facto* laws. **This is only partly true**. If an ex post facto law is enacted not impairing the rights or obligations of contracts and if it is favourable to the accused, then such law is valid.
> 
> Additionally, the video made no distinction between ex post facto and retroactive laws. If any, there is wrongful association between ex post facto laws and retroactive laws by saying that all laws must be prospective. **This is wrong**.
> 
> Ex post facto laws are retroactive laws, but not all retroactive laws are ex post facto laws.
> 
> In the context of tax law provisions, the proper term used should have been *retroactive* laws. Ex post facto laws deal with the charging of a criminal action which was previously legal but made illegal after the effectivity of a law. However, retroactive laws deal with having the effects of a law prior to its effectivity.
> 
> Ex post facto laws are prohibited under the 1987 Philippine Constitution, but retroactive laws are not. Actually, even the New Civil Code (R.A. 386) states that *generally*, laws shall have no retroactive effect *unless otherwise provided* in law.
> 
> But still, the question begs: whether tax laws can be retroactive by nature seeing that non-compliance to tax laws may result to the sanction of criminal liabilities. There is no Supreme Court ruling for this subject matter yet, so, being on the safe side, I think that it is better to assume that tax laws may not have retroactive effects.
> 
> The only thing certain regarding the prohibition of retroactive effect involving tax laws are those Revenue Regulations issued by the Secretary of Finance upon the recommendation of the Commissioner. Section 246 of the National Internal Revenue Code thus read:
> 
> > **Section 246.** *Non- Retroactivity of Rulings.* - Any revocation, modification or reversal of any of the rules and regulations promulgated in accordance with the preceding Sections or any of the rulings or circulars promulgated by the Commissioner shall not be given retroactive application if the revocation, modification or reversal will be prejudicial to the taxpayers, except in the following cases:
> > - Where the taxpayer deliberately misstates or omits material facts from his return or any document required of him by the Bureau of Internal Revenue;
> > - Where the facts subsequently gathered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue are materially different from the facts on which the ruling is based; or
> > - Where the taxpayer acted in bad faith.
> 
> *Video in question: Taxes, Tax Laws, and Administration > Tax Laws vs Revenue Regulations vs Rulings, at 09:11.*
> 
> **Further Research: Income Taxation, by Tabag and Garcia**: It is true that tax laws shall generally be prospective by nature. However, a tax law may also be retrospective by nature, but is discouraged. A retrospective law should not be given if it would be harsh and oppressive which violate the taxpayerâ€™s constitutional rights regarding equality and due process.
