Tax Remedies refer to those remedies availed of by the government or the taxpayer involving the assessment and collection of taxes. These remedies ensure fairness and due process for taxpayers while still allowing the government to collect revenue efficiently.[^1]

Provisions governing tax remedies are enclosed under Title VIII - Remedies of the [[../../../11 - Philippine Statutes/National Internal Revenue Code/National Internal Revenue Code|National Internal Revenue Code]], as amended.

> [!tip]- Recall: Levy, Assessment, and Collection  
> Levy is the process of imposing tax to an object. Assessment refers to determining the amount due by the taxpayer. Collection refers to the actual collection of tax due by the taxpayer.
> 
> Both assessment and collection are executive/administrative by nature. Levy is a legislative function.

## Preliminary Knowledge
The following terms are crucial to obtain understanding of this lesson:

**Dates to remember** - The following dates are important in determining the prescriptible period in availing remedies provided for by law, especially to those dates when applying the *statute of limitations* under the NIRC.
- Filing deadline - refers to the deadline for filing a tax return to the government. The filing deadline, in conjunction with the actual filing date of the taxpayer, is generally used to determine the prescriptive period of when the government may avail its remedies against the taxpayer, such as making an assessment to a taxpayer. Also see: [[./Filing Deadlines for National Taxes|Filing Deadlines for National Taxes]]
- Payment deadline - refers to the deadline for paying the tax due owed by the taxpayer. The payment deadline, in conjunction with the actual payment date of the taxpayer, is generally used either to determine the accrual of interest on late payments by the taxpayer (also referred to as *delinquent interest*), or the recovery of erroneously paid taxes by the taxpayer.

**Remedies** - Remedies refer to those *options* by the taxpayer or the government of ensuring fair collection of taxes within a specific set of processes. Adherence to this due process is crucial of abiding the [[./PH Bill of Rights - Right to due process and equal protection of law|right to due process]], unless waived.
- Administrative Remedy - refers to those remedies which may be availed at the administrative/executive level. It also includes summary remedies.
	- Summary Remedy - refers to those remedies that are executed without ceremony or delay. They are usually done by the government when collecting tax dues against the taxpayer.
- Judicial Remedy - refers to those remedies which may be availed at the judiciary level. As a general rule, all administrative remedies must be exhausted before a person may avail of a judicial remedy. A judicial remedy may involve a civil case or a criminal case, or both. Note that criminal cases are generally only filed by the government to the taxpayer to a lower court, while civil cases may be filed either by the government or the taxpayer to the [[./Court of Tax Appeals|Court of Tax Appeals]].

**Classification of Taxpayers** - This concept is generally applied for provisions amended by the Ease of Paying Taxes (EOPT) Act to the NIRC. The gross sales of the taxpayer is used to determine the classification of a taxpayer:

| Classification | Floor         | Ceiling     |
| -------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| Micro          | 0             | 2,999,999   |
| Small          | 3,000,000     | 19,999,999  |
| Medium         | 20,000,000    | 999,999,999 |
| Large          | 1,000,000,000 | –           |

Note that the amounts above are exact floors and ceilings amount.
## Assessment of Tax Due (incl. disputing)
The government may assess the tax due of a taxpayer to ensure compliance to tax laws. A taxpayer may be selected for assessment if their business is in a high-risk industry, designated by the [[./Bureau of Internal Revenue|Bureau of Internal Revenue]] as top audit priorities, reported by another individual (for claiming of tax rewards), or programs of the government, such as a Tax Compliance Verification Drive or Tax Mapping.

> Note that the BIR always conducts pre-audits of the tax due of a taxpayer. A pre-audit works on the premise that the return filed is assumed to be correct. The BIR then conducts mathematical accuracy in computing the tax paid provided for in the tax return.

### National Taxes
The Bureau of Internal Revenue is the primary agency responsible for assessing and collecting national taxes. Therefore, it follows that if disputes or controversies relating to the tax due of a taxpayer arises, administrative remedies may be first availed by the government or taxpayer through the BIR. If administrative remedies have been fully exhausted and has reached finality, the taxpayer may then resort to judicial remedies.

#### Letter of Authority
A [[Letter of Authority|Letter of Authority]] is a document issued by the BIR to initiate a tax audit or investigation of a taxpayer for national taxes that regularly occur in the ordinary course of business. This letter grants the BIR to examine and scrutinize a taxpayer’s books, records, and other relevant documents for tax compliance. A letter of authority is considered valid if:

1. It is printed under the electronic Letter of Authority Monitoring System, or eLAMS.
2. It is served to the taxpayer **30 days** from the date indicated in the letter. 
	- The service of this letter is delivered personally- a Revenue Officer or any BIR Employee, as duly authorized, will deliver a copy of the letter to the taxpayer’s registered or known address. However, if personal service is not available, especially if the taxpayer is not present at the registered or known address, the BIR may resort to substituted service, or service by mail.[^2]
3. It identifies what types of tax are covered by the Letter of Authority being subjected to tax audit.
4. It requests for the submission of documents relevant to the scope of tax audit.[^3]
5. One letter of authority for one taxpayer only. A letter of authority cannot contain multiple names of a taxpayer, whether natural or juridical persons.
6. One letter of authority for one taxable year only, though it may be subject to certain exemptions (as provided below)

A letter of authority is valid only for **120 days**, and its prescription starts when the letter of authority is actually served to the taxpayer. It can be revalidated if the government needs more time to conduct tax audits. It shall also be signed by the appropriate officer based on the classification of the taxpayer:

| Classification                   | Issuer                                                                              | Revalidation |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Micro, Small, or Medium Taxpayer | Regional District Office, signed by Regional Director                               | Only once    |
| Large Taxpayer                   | Large Taxpayer Service Audit Division (LTSAD), signed by the Assistant Commissioner | Twice        |
| *Super Large* Taxpayer[^4]       | National or Special Investigation Division, signed by the Commissioner itself.      | Twice        |

A taxpayer may only be subject to tax audit once per taxable year. However, there are exceptions to this rule:
- If there is irregularities or fraud;
- If the taxpayer requests for reinvestigation;
- If it is for the purposes of verifying of withholding tax obligations[^5] or capital gains tax;[^6]
- If it is exercised for the purposes of the Commissioner’s power to obtain information from third parties in order to corroborate the tax due of another person. This power of the Commissioner allows them to issue the following summons:
	- *[[./Subpoena duces tecum|Subpoena duces tecum]]* - to compel the procurement of documents. Non-compliance to this subpoena may result to penalties and judicial recourse.
	- *[[./Subpoena ad testificandum|Subpoena ad testificandum]]* - to summon a taxpayer to provide testimony over a case.

Alternatively, a [[Tax Verification Notice|Tax Verification Notice]] may be issued, which has a similar effect to that of a Letter of Authority, but is generally used for one-time transactions (such as Tax arising from an Estate or Donation).

> [!hint]- Letter Notice  
> A [[./Letter Notice|Letter Notice]] *may* also be given by the Bureau of Internal Revenue prior to the issuance of a letter of authority, notifying the taxpayer that significant discrepancies exist in their system and to those filed by the taxpayer. Note that a Letter Notice is usually given ***before*** a Letter of Authority.
> 
> Note, also, that a Letter Notice is different to that of a [[Notice of Discrepancy|Notice of Discrepancy]]. A notice of discrepancy notifies the taxpayer that, *as a result of tax audit*, discrepancies were found by the BIR. A Letter Notice merely informs that discrepancies exist *on BIR’s system* without conducting a tax audit on the books of the taxpayer.

#### Notice of Discrepancy[^7]
The BIR will then issue a Notice of Discrepancy to a taxpayer with deficient tax paid. A Notice of Discrepancy informs the taxpayer that *as a result of tax audit*, discrepancies exist between the tax paid by the taxpayer and the computed tax due by the BIR.

The Notice of Discrepancy schedules a Discussion of Discrepancy between the BIR and the taxpayer, and shall be held within 30 days from the issuance of such notice. During the discussion, the taxpayer explains their side of the story on the discrepancies given attention to by the BIR and provide any relevant pieces of evidence to support such claim. Note that the discussion is done orally.

The taxpayer may, at its option, sign a Waiver of the Defence of Prescription. This waiver waives the taxpayer’s prescriptive period of 3 years for assessing taxes. Note that this waiver need be notarized before a public office- the waiver need be a public document.

#### Preliminary Assessment Notice
If the taxpayer is unable to resolve some line-items, then the BIR issues a Preliminary Assessment Notice (PAN), or a Deficiency Tax Assessment, within 10 days after the holding of said discussion, in written form.

The taxpayer may reply within 15 days upon receipt of a PAN. The reply of the taxpayer shall be categorical. Meaning, the taxpayer shall specifically dispute line-items mentioned in the assessment as part of their defence.[^8]

Note that the PAN is not a formal assessment and does not establish a tax claim from a tax payer by the government. The issuance of PAN is necessary prior to the issuance of a Final Assessment Notice, lest the latter be null and void for not adhering to the procedural due process required of by law.

Upon reply by the taxpayer, or if, upon the lapse of the 15 day period, there is no reply by the taxpayer, the BIR **may finally** issue a Final Assessment Notice/Formal Letter of Demand. However, some cases may warrant the BIR to issue the Final Assessment Notice without initial issuance of a PAN. Cases are as follow:
- If the tax deficiency arises from mathematical error of the taxpayer;
- There is a tax deficiency between the tax withheld and the remitted amount;
- The tax claim is applied with tax credit twice;
- If the processor of the excisable article does not pay for excise tax *and* such article leaves the place of business or manufacturing; or
- Excisable goods are sold by exempt persons to non-exempt persons.

#### Final Assessment Notice
A Final Assessment Notice (FAN),[^9] or a Formal Letter of Demand (FLD), obliges the tax payer to pay the assessed tax by the BIR after considering the stance of the taxpayer, denying, whether in part or wholly, the defence set forth.

A FAN is considered to be valid if it has the following characteristics or elements:
- Issued within the prescriptive period, which shall be 3 years from filing date or actual filing date, whichever is latter, but except if the tax return is not filed or filed with intent to defraud, to which the prescription period shall be 10 years from the discovery of non-filing or fraudulent filing of tax return;
- Contain the information about discrepancy;
- Detailed discussion of the facts and legal basis of the claim;
- Demand for payment by the taxpayer; and
- Delivered/sent by registered mail or by delivery.

The FAN will also contain the amount of tax due by the taxpayer as a result of the tax audit. Generally, the computation for the assessed tax due are as follow:
- Tax due by the taxpayer[^10]
- + 25% surcharge of the tax due by the tax payer
- + 12% interest of the tax due by the tax payer,[^11] per annum
- = Total tax due by the taxpayer

The interest due by the taxpayer is computed from the later date between the filing deadline and the actual filing of the taxpayer. The actual amount of days in a year (generally 365) is used to compute for the interest.

The total tax due by the taxpayer shall be paid on a date provided by the BIR ==and shall be the basis for negotiating a compromise with the BIR==. If it is not settled by the taxpayer, then an additional 12% delinquent interest of the ==total tax due== by the taxpayer is added for every day that the taxpayer delays on their payment of tax. Non-compliance to payment of taxes give rise to civil and criminal liabilities against a taxpayer. The BIR may file a judicial action against a taxpayer even if dispute between the taxpayer is ongoing.

The BIR is also given 5 years to take a course of action (i.e., collect what is due) from the date of the FAN/FLD, **even if the tax return filed by the taxpayer is fraudulent**.

The taxpayer may either file for a motion/petition for reinvestigation or reconsideration 30 days after receipt of a FAN.
- A motion for reinvestigation warrants the taxpayer to present additional pieces of evidence not initially present during the Discussion of Discrepancy, or reply to the PAN. Said pieces of evidence need be submitted to the BIR 60 days after filing such motion.
- A motion for reconsideration disputes or questions the legal facts/issues outlined by the BIR. Examples include the potential erroneous application of the law.

After the filing of a motion for reconsideration, or the submission of pieces of evidence for a petition for reinvestigation, the BIR has 180 days to evaluate and render a decision on the motion filed. The final decision of the BIR is referred to as the *Final Decision on Disputed Assessment*.

> However, if there is no decision by the BIR during the 180 day period, the taxpayer may either wait for the reply of the BIR *or* proceed to the [[./Court of Tax Appeals|Court of Tax Appeals]] within a period of 30 days (i.e., the FAN, upon lapse of the 180 day period, is logically considered as final, hence, the same time period for the filing of a case to the CTA to that of an FDDA is observed).
> 
> If the motion is denied by the BIR, they *may* send a Preliminary Correction letter which denies the motion filed by the taxpayer.

#### Final Decision on Disputed Assessment (FDDA)
The Final Decision on Disputed Assessment is the final decision of the BIR for a taxpayer disputing an assessment made by the BIR in lieu of its tax audits. It also gives rise to the government to collect what is due from the taxpayer. This is the final administrative remedy availed of by a taxpayer for disputing a tax assessment.

The taxpayer has 30 days to file a case to the [[./Court of Tax Appeals|Court of Tax Appeals]] *in division*.

If the FDDA is issued by a Regional Director (i.e., for micro, small, and medium taxpayers), the taxpayer ==may== elevate the case to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue through the filing of a motion for reconsideration.

> Note, however, that the period of the taxpayer to file a case to the CTA *in division* is still counted. Meaning, if an FDDA is issued by a Regional Director, and then the taxpayer raises this matter to the Commissioner, and subsequently, the Commissioner renders and affirms the same decision as that of a Regional Director after a period of 5 days, the taxpayer now only has 25 days to file a case to the CTA *in division*.  
> 
> However, if the Commissioner renders a revised decision to that of the Regional Director, the period of 30 days to file the case judicially restarts.

> Note that no collection is to be collected by the BIR, unless a decision has reached *administrative finality*.

#### Judicial Remedies
Judicial remedies may be availed by the taxpayer if all administrative remedies were already exhausted by the taxpayer and an administrative decision has reached finality. The process are as follow:
- Filing of a case to the [[./Court of Tax Appeals|Court of Tax Appeals]] *in division*, through a motion/petition for reconsideration.
- Filing of a case to the CTA *en banc*, through a motion/petition for review.
- Filing of a case to the [[./Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] *in division*, through a motion/petition for reconsideration.
- Filing of a case to the SC *en banc*, through a motion/petition for review.

Note that after a decision by the Court of Tax Appeals, whether in division or en banc, or of the Supreme Court in division, is rendered, the taxpayer generally has 15 days[^12] to to file another case to the next level of the judiciary.

> Note that the terms *petition for review on certiorari* is interchangeable with *petition for review*. However, a **petition for certiorari** is different.
> 
> What is required under this matter is a petition for review on certiorari and **not** a petition for certiorari.

> [!hint]- Collection of taxes by the BIR for Judicial Cases vs Administrative Cases  
> Note that the BIR shall collect the taxes due over judicial cases within a period of 3 years. This is in contrast to the period of 5 years for the BIR to take action upon issuance of a FAN/FLD.

### Local Taxes
…

## Collection of Tax Due
After the assessment of the BIR of the tax due by a taxpayer, the BIR may then collect what is owed by the taxpayer from the government.

Collection by the BIR is actioned 5 years upon finality of an administrative case against a taxpayer. In so doing, the BIR may exercise its summary remedies to claim the properties of the taxpayer.
- Levy - used to seize the real properties of a taxpayer
- Distraint - used to seize the personal properties of the taxpayer. It may either be constructive- noting that the property shall be preserved and not disposed or transferred to anyone, which has the same effect of freezing the personal property- or actual- the actual possession of the personal property of the taxpayer.

The BIR may only exercise levy or distraint if the taxpayer: has an unpaid tax liability, which has become final, executory, and demandable; or if it fails to pay such liability despite having received a formal demand from the BIR. Note that the BIR may still claim the taxes due owed by the taxpayer through a civil or criminal case even without a FAN being issued.

In coercively collecting the tax due against a taxpayer, due process must still be adhered to:
- A Preliminary Collection is issued to the taxpayer.
- A Final Assessment before Seizure Letter is then issued to the taxpayer 10 days following the issuance of a Preliminary Collection.
- The BIR then issues a Warrant of Distraint or Levy if the tax due of the taxpayer exceeds PHP 100.00. It is issued 91 days after an assessment has become final, executory, and demandable.
- The BIR then conducts a research on the taxpayer’s properties to determine which real properties to seize in order to satisfy the claim of the government (for tax levy)
- A Notice of Tax Lien or Notice of Levy is issued to the taxpayer.
	- A Tax Lien attaches to the property itself. It makes the property a priority claim for the government.
	- Meanwhile, a Tax Levy is the actual legal seizure of the property in favour of the government to satisfy tax debt. *Note that the term **tax levy** is also used when acquiring personal properties*.
- The levied property is then put into public auction 20 days after levy. The property is then sold to the highest bidder and absorbs the following tax deficiencies of the erring taxpayer (based on the amount paid by the bidder):
	- Tax due
	- Penalties and interest
	- Expenses of distraint/levy
	- Cost of selling properties
- However, if there are no bidders, the property acquired is forfeited in favour of the Philippine Republic.

The BIR issues a Warrant of Distraint or a Warrant of Levy again and again for as long as there are tax debts against the taxpayer.

The taxpayer may also avail of compromises to minimize the amount of taxes to be paid to the government. Also see: [[./Escapes from Taxation#Compromise and Abatement|Escapes from Taxation > Compromise and Abatement]]

## Recovery of Erroneously Paid Taxes: National
A taxpayer may also recover erroneously paid taxes to the government.

A taxpayer, 2 years from the date of payment of tax due, or in case of instalment payments of taxes due, the last day of an instalment payment, may avail of the remedy of recovering erroneously paid taxes to the BIR thru the filing of a *Claim for Refund or Credit*.

The taxpayer may file a petition for review to the CTA if the BIR does not reply to the claim for refund within the same period of 2 years, or if the BIR denies the claim for refund within 30 days (but still within the 2 year period). The judicial remedies for this type of remedy is similar to that of the [[Tax Remedies#Judicial Remedies|Judicial Remedies]] provided for for disputing tax assessments.

## Inbox
Inability to pay compromise (10%) can be availed of after availment of judicial remedies. However, for doubtful validity (40%), it can only be availed during the administrative remedies stage.

[^3]: The documents relevant for a taxable transaction is assumed to be stored in the office of the business, or shall have not left the same. If the taxpayer was not able to provide, the BIR will send a second request for the documents required. However, if still unable, a *[[./Subpoena duces tecum|Subpoena duces tecum]]* will be issued against the taxpayer. Non-compliance to the subpoena will result to a criminal case filed against the taxpayer, notwithstanding the procedures for tax audit by the BIR (it will still push through).
[^4]: The term *super large* is not a valid legal classification, but an informal one. This term was mentioned in REO Pre-recorded videos under Batch 9.
[^5]: A Letter of Authority for conducting a tax audit for withholding tax obligations may be done multiple times in a year.
[^6]: A Notice Verification for conducting a tax audit of capital gains tax may be done multiple times in a year since CGT are one-time transactions but may occur multiple times in a year.
[^7]: Formerly known as *Notice of Informal Conference*.
[^8]: Merely saying that “we do not agree *in toto*” without explanation whatsoever will not be considered.
[^9]: In some Revenue District Offices of the BIR, the FAN is also referred to as an *Assessment Notice - Final Letter of Demand*.
[^10]: Note that in case of non-filing by the tax payer for a particular tax, the actual amount of basic tax due is the tax due by the taxpayer. However, in case of tax payer in partial compliance for a particular tax matter, then only the unpaid amount of such tax shall be included in the tax due of the taxpayer. This amount is computed by finding the difference between the audited tax due of the BIR and the reported tax due by the taxpayer.
[^11]: Note also that the 12% interest per annum is charged against the tax due of the tax payer **excluding** the surcharge resulting from late payment by the taxpayer.
[^12]: The 15 day deadline for the filing of a petition for reconsideration or review is provided for by the Rules of Court. Specifically, by Rule 37 of the Rules of Court. Courts interpret filing periods strictly in the interest of finality and efficiency.
