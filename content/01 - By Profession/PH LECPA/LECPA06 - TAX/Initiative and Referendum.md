Initiative and Referendum, when referring to Philippine context, refers to the exercise of the peopleâ€™s direct democracy wherein the people, through a plebiscite, may propose and enact laws or approve or reject laws passed by the Congress or of a legislative authority under a local government unit.

This right is enshrined as a Constitutional provision. Specifically, under Article VI Section 32 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution which provides:

> **Article VI Section 32**. The Congress shall, as early as possible, provide for a system of initiative and referendum, and the exceptions therefrom, whereby the people can directly propose and enact laws or approve or reject any act or law or part thereof passed by the Congress or local legislative body after the registration of a petition therefor signed by at least ten per centum of the total number of registered voters, of which every legislative district must be represented by at least three per centum of the registered voters thereof.

The enabling law for this provision is *The Initiative and Referendum Act*, enacted as [Republic Act No. 6735](https://lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1989/ra_6735_1989.html).
