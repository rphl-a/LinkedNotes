At first glance, the terms *amendments* and *revisions* may entail change and share the same meaning. However, in the context of Philippine laws, amendments refer to minor changes in a particular document, while revisions refer to the substantial changing of a document.

This classification is important especially when interpreting the Philippine Constitution- on how the basic law may be amended or revised, and the procedures and conditions therefor.
