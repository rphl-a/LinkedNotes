A predominance test is a test conducted on foreign corporations to determine where the majority of its income is earned (i.e., within the Philippines or abroad?).

In conducting a predominance test, the previous gross income of the corporation over a period of three years (in the case of dividends, from the year it is declared) is summed. Its formula are as follow:  
$$\sum\frac{{G_{PH}}}{G_{w}}$$  
whereas:
- $G_{PH}$ is the gross income earned within the Philippines; and
- $G_w$ is the gross income earned by the corporation from all countries.
