## As to purpose
Primarily, taxes are **fiscal** by nature- used to raise revenues for the government. However, it may also be regulatory by **nature**- used to regulate certain activities and compensate for social costs associated with certain behaviours and industries.

## As to subject matter
The subject matter of taxation refers to the object of taxation- of *what* is being taxed by the law. There are three subject matters in tax:
- Personal, poll, or capitation. Tax is imposed on individuals residing within a specified territory without regard to their property or occupation.
- Property. Tax is imposed on the location of the property.
- Excise or privilege. Tax is imposed in the performance of an act, or of an enjoyment of privilege, or of an occupation.

This concept is similar to the [[./Taxation Characterized#Situs of Taxation|Situs of Taxation]] in that it refers to the location of the economic activity that is being taxed.
## As to incidence
The incidence of tax asks on *who* is being taxed by the law. It also refers to the division of tax burden between the stakeholders, generally between the sellers/producers and buyers/consumers.

There are two tax incidence recognized:
- Direct incidence, if the statutory taxpayer pays for the tax itself, or if the impact and incidence of taxation is merged into the statutory taxpayer.
- Indirect incidence, if the statutory taxpayer shifts the payment of tax to other.

> [!question]- (UNANSWERED) Shifting vs Assigning, in relation to the nature of tax  
> It was mentioned that tax is different from debt in that the latter can be assigned while the former, not. However, this contradicts to the classification of taxes in terms of its incidence.
> 
> On one end, tax shifted to another statutory taxpayer is similar to assigning the payment of tax to another. Therefore, is tax similar to a debt in that they can be assigned or shifted to another people?
> 
> If any, the mere difference is the liberty to choose who pays the tax. In the law on obligation and contracts, the assignment of a debt usually requires the consent of all the parties involved (necessitating that the valid elements of a contract are present). However, in the law on tax, the shifting of tax to another merely requires the purchase of a goods from a seller/producer.
> 
> I think this is the only differentiating factor between *indirect incidence* and the topic of *Tax vs debt*, especially when specific on its assignability. But then again, what is the difference between *shifting* and *assigning*?

## As to amount
Taxes may either be **specific**- a fixed peso amount per item purchased or consumed- or ***ad valorem***- a fixed percentage based on the value of item.
## As to rate
Taxes may be classified as to their rates:
- Progressive rates,[^1] wherein high income earners are taxed more. The tax rate is directly proportional to a tax base.
- Regressive rates, wherein high income earners are taxed less. The tax rate is indirectly proportional to a tax base.
- Proportional rates, wherein the tax imposed is based on a fixed amount or rate regardless of income or wealth.
- Mixed rates.
## As to imposing authority
Taxes may be classified either as a national or a local tax:
