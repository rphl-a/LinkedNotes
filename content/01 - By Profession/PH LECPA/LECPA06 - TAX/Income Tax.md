Income tax refers to a [[national tax|national tax]] that is levied against a taxpayer’s gross income for a transaction. [[Revenue Regulations|Revenue Regulations]] define it as *all wealth which flows into the taxpayer other than a mere return of capital and includes gains*.
## Fundamental Principles
Income tax is consistent with the [[Ability to pay theory|Ability to pay theory]] of taxation. It also features characteristics which is used to determine whether an income is taxable or not under income taxation:
- It *exhibits a return **on** capital*. Simply put, it involves a selling price and the cost by which the item is sold. The resulting gain is a return on capital.[^1] Items valued finitely[^2] consist of a return on capital, while those valued infinitely[^3] does not.[^4]
- It *exhibits **realized** benefit*. Items subjected to income tax shall result to an exchange of value (i.e., either a sale or a barter) between other persons, whether natural (individuals) or juridical[^5] (corporations) persons, **and** increase their net worth.
- It is ***not exempted** by the Constitution, or of treaties, laws, and contracts*. Also see: [[Tax exemptions provided by the 1987 Philippine Constitution|Tax exemptions provided by the 1987 Philippine Constitution]].

It is imposed to all persons, whether natural or juridical, and each taxpayer has a two-fold obligation when it comes to income tax: **to pay** and **to withhold**.[^6]

A taxpayer’s obligation to pay includes an obligation to file a return to the [[Bureau of Internal Revenue|Bureau of Internal Revenue]]. A non-filing of return by the taxpayer constitutes tax avoidance, which is a crime and includes civil liabilities.

## Taxpayers’ Classification
Natural persons refer to citizens and aliens subject to tax. Juridical persons refer to corporations[^7] established under PH laws. They are further classified to determine which of their transactions are subject to tax (i.e., within or without the Philippines).

| Classification                                      | Taxed on           | Criteria                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Resident citizen                                    | Within and without | General assumption for citizens                                                                                     |
| Non-resident citizen                                | Within             | `≥ 183 days` of stay in PH                                                                                          |
| Resident alien                                      | Within             | `> 1 year` of stay in PH                                                                                            |
| Non-resident alien engaged in trade or business     | Within             | `> 180 days` of stay in PH                                                                                          |
| Non-resident alien not engaged in trade or business | Within             | General assumption for aliens                                                                                       |
| Domestic corporation                                | Within and without | Established under PH laws, including subsidiaries established by foreign corporations. Also a *general assumption*. |
| Resident *foreign* corporation                      | Within             | Established elsewhere but with physical office or branch in PH. Also referred to as a *resident corporation*.       |
| Non-resident foreign corporation                    | Within             | Established elsewhere and with no physical office or branch in PH.                                                  |

In the case of natural persons, they are classified based on their **intention** as a citizen or alien; do they intend to work full-time abroad? do they have a tourist Visa or a working visa? If their intentions cannot be determined, their **stay** in the country is used.

## Classification of income tax
Income tax may be classified into three types:
- [[Final Income Tax|Final Income Tax]], which is a tax imposed to *certain* types of **passive** income
- [[Capital Gains Tax|Capital Gains Tax]], which is a tax imposed to *certain* types of **active** income
- [[Regular Income Tax|Regular Income Tax]], which is a tax imposed to passive or active income not subject to final tax. 

As a general rule, items subjected to final income tax or capital gains tax can no longer be subjected to regular income tax since these two types of income tax are considered as *final tax*- if an item taxed can no longer be subject to any other forms of internal revenue tax under the [[National Internal Revenue Code|National Internal Revenue Code]].

## Accounting periods
Accounting periods are used in taxation to determine the deadline for filing/payment of taxes by a company, or which of its transactions are subject to tax for a given **taxable year**.

Generally, an accounting period for tax purposes is composed of 12 months in a taxable year, and may be further classified into:
- *Calendar year*, which begins on January 01 and ends on December 31; or
- *Fiscal year*, which begins at any month of a given year and ends after 12 months.

Corporations can choose either calendar or fiscal years. However, individuals may only resort to calendar year as their accounting method. The regular calendar/fiscal year shall **always be at a period of 12 months, regardless** of the actual accounting period used under [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles|Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]].

However, there are some instances wherein an accounting period for tax purposes may be shorter than 12 months. Examples include the death of a taxpayer, the establishment or cessation of a business, the change of accounting period by a corporation, or the termination of accounting period by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.[^8]

## Accounting methods
Accounting methods, for purposes of taxation, are used to measure a taxpayer’s income. It is similar to the cash and accrual basis of [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles|Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]], but with notable differences:
- **Advanced income is taxable upon receipt**; and
- **Prepayments are non-deductible**.

[^1]: Note that it is the return **on** capital that is being taxed and not the return of capital. Because a return on capital results to an increased net assets of the taxpayer, while a return of capital does not. A good example are loans. Loans represent borrowed money to another with expectation of its return with interest. The principal from a loan is not taxable since it represents a return of capital, but the interest gained from loan is taxable because it represents a return on capital. This characteristic is consistent with the next characteristic in that is *exhibits a realized benefit*.
[^2]: Examples include gains derived from selling the ordinary and capital assets of a taxpayer. Note that a return of lost profits- that is, the amount recovered from lost profits- is taxable, such as proceeds from crop or livestock insurance, damages claimed over an intellectual property infringement suit, and guarantee income payments. 
[^3]: Examples include life, health, and reputation. In the case of life, the best example for this is life insurance. A life insurance generally is not taxable. However, once it endows (or matures), or if it contains a cash surrender value, it can be subjected to income tax. In the case of health, hospital bills, and any monies paid from physical or mental harm, is not taxable. But lost salaries as a result of hospitalization or accident is taxable.
[^4]: To put simply, a finite value can be measured. As such, a certain percentage of the amount is added to the capital used to purchase such item. You cannot add a profit margin to an item that is valued infinitely. 
[^5]: Sole proprietorships do not possess a juridical entity- that is, its proprietor is not separate from the proprietorship. Hence, it is considered as a natural person.
[^6]: Withholding means ==TODO==
[^7]: Corporations, as used under this context, refers to those entities that have a separate juridical entity from that of a natural person. Generally owned by two or more persons, whether natural or juridical.
[^8]: Reasons or grounds for termination include if the taxpayer is: intending to leave the country, or removing the properties of the taxpayer in their usual site of business, or doing an act that will obstruct the collection of taxes.
