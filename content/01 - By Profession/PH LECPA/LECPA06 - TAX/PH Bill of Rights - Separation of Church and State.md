The free worship rule refers to the free exercise of religion in the country as provided under the 1987 Philippine Constitution. It reads:

> **ARTICLE III SECTION 5.** No law shall be made respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. The free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall forever be allowed. No religious test shall be required for the exercise of civil or political rights.

The abovementioned provision prohibits the government on creating laws that establishes a religion or the prohibition of its free exercise. Free exercise may also involve the free promulgation of religious works, such as the promulgation of literary pieces or transcripts related to a religion.

This is also in consonance with the separation of the church and the state:

> **ARTICLE III SECTION 6**. The separation of Church and State shall be inviolable.

Finally, public funds cannot also be used for religious purposes, unless if it is assigned to the Armed Forces of the Philippines, or to any penal institution, or to a government orphanage or leprosarium. (Article VI Section 29(2))

> **ARTICLE VI SECTION 29(2)**. No public money or property shall be appropriated, applied, paid, or employed, directly or indirectly, for the use, benefit, or support of any sect, church, denomination, sectarian institution, or system of religion, or of any priest, preacher, minister, other religious teacher, or dignitary as such, except when such priest, preacher, minister, or dignitary is assigned to the armed forces, or to any penal institution, or government orphanage or leprosarium.

Note, that the church referred herein is not limited to the Catholic church, which is also the dominant religion in the Philippines as of time of writing. The term *church*, as used in the context of the Philippine Constitution, refers to any church established and organized for religious purposes.
