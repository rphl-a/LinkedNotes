## Notes
- Inherent powers of the state → powers vested in the government and need not be provided by basic law- the government can exercise these inherent powers in governing a nation- of providing the **common needs** to a nation.
	- The government is formed through a basic law, enacted by the people
- Fundamental Principles of Taxation
	- Definition of Taxation
		- [/] Power → inherent power of the state to demand enforced contribution for public purpose to support the government
			- Taxation is a power because it is a mandatory imposition by the government. It compels the citizens of a country to contribute to the nation.
			- The powers (as definition of taxation)
				- Taxation
				- Eminent domain → to take private property for ==public use==
					- Right of the government to take property for public use
				- Police power → enforce laws to protect the well-being of the people
					- As a form of regulating the freedom by the government
				- If forming a government, the people need to recognize that these powers shall exist.
				- (Refer to TAX 01 Notes)
					- Eminent domain exercise → private entities vested with public function (i.e., public utilities)
					- Delegation (National government - no delegation needed)
						- Taxation → **not necessary**
							- Not provided for in the PH Constitution
						- Police power → Article XVI Section 6
						- Eminent domain → 
						- Local government units hierarchy (Congress shall delegate to LGUs)
					- Purpose
						- Taxation → primary purpose is to raise revenue and support of the government.
						- Purpose → protection of well-being of the people
						- Eminent domain → taken for public use
					- Persons
						- Eminent domain → only for certain places
					- Amount of imposition
						- Taxation → Unlimited
							- Unlimited → no maximum nor minimum amounts
							- [x] Further research
						- Police power → Limited to cost of regulation
							- i.e., penalties provided for by Special laws, such as the Penal Code
							- [x] Licensing is a police power?
								- Penalties if ventured without the necessary license
								- Limited exercise of powers, ensures that experts or qualified individuals possess such licenses
						- Eminent domain → no money involved
					- [>] Importance
						- Police power → most superior
							- [ ] Further research
					- Relationship
						- Non-impairment clause (in contract): hindi pwede i-set aside ng government ang kanyang obligation by exercising this power;
					- Limitations
						- Taxation → two limitations
							- Constitutionally limited 
							- Inherently limited → 
				- Similarities of the three powers
					- They are necessary attributes to sovereignty, exists independently of the basic law but its conditions for the exercise of a government may be provided therefor.
					- They are legislative in nature
						- [x] Three branches of the PH government
							- Co-equalness as a principle of checks and balances
					- Methods in which the State interferes with private rights and property
					- Presupposes an equivalent compensation affected by the exercise of such power, whether directly, indirectly, or remote.
					- Exercise by LGUs may be limited by national legislature
		- [x] Process → legislative act of laying a tax to raise income for the government to defray its necessary expenses
			- Aspects of taxation:
				- The Legislative authority creates and enacts laws for the imposition of tax under their statutory jurisdiction
					- The actual power of taxation is delegated to the Congress, but the same may vest the power to tax to the LGUs
					- Also known as the impact of taxation
					- Refers to the levying or imposition of tax
					- Process of creating laws:
						- Tax bills originate from the House of Representatives. However, laws passed in the House of Representatives may be substituted with another Bill in the Senate if the same bill passed in the lower house has passed the same.
							- ! Note: companion bills may be introduced in both House of Congress. Basta dapat may version ang HOR.
						- After both House of Congress shall have agreed, it is sent to the President for their signature. If signed, it becomes a law. If not signed:
							- …and vetoes the law, the affected provisions of the vetoed provision is not treated as part of the law, unless the Legislative, upon the concurrence of x number of both House of Congress, overrides the veto of the President.
							- …and does not veto the law within x days, it becomes a law as if the President shall have sign it.
				- The Executive authority administers tax to affected individuals
					- Also known as the incidence of taxation
					- Refers to the assessment and collection of tax in accordance to laws
					- Tax is a voluntary requirement. The Executive merely collects what is due from the citizens.
					- Issuances of Revenue Regulations and Guidelines are administrative/executive acts.
		- [/] Mode of Cost Allocation → allocating government burden to the people
			- Most practical definition of taxation
			- Theories of allocation:
				- Benefits Received Theory
					- The more benefits received, the more tax you should pay
					- Based on the principle of fairness.
					- Receipt of benefit is conclusively presumed if the person is a citizen or a resident of the Philippines.
					- Good example is Business Taxes
				- Ability to Pay Theory
					- [ ] TODO: Further definition
					- Good example is Income Taxes
					- Measures of ability to pay:
						- Vertical Equity
							- Correlates directly to the value of being taxed
						- Horizontal Equity
							- Circumstance of the taxpayer
								- Ex.: Industry 1 has more expenses than Industry 2. Therefore, Industry 2 is taxed more.
