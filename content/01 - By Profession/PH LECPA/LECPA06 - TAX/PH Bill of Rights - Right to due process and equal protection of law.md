Article III Section 1 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution refers to the right to due process and the equal protection of law. It reads:

> **ARTICLE III SECTION 1**. No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor shall any person be denied the equal protection of the laws.

## Due Process
Due process may be classified into two: procedural and substantive.
### Procedural Due Process
Procedural due process refers to the procedures and manners required in enforcing a law. This include the provision of notice, the opportunity to be heard, judgement based on evidence presented, and the right to appeal (in some cases).

### Substantive Due Process
Substantive due process meanwhile refers to the substance of the law itself. Meaning, it requires that laws and regulations enacted by the government be reasonable, fair, and just. Further, laws shall be express, categorical, and unequivocal.

## Equal Protection of Law
The equal protection of law refers to the protection afforded to individuals or a group of individuals. No distinction shall be made when enforcing a law, but laws may nonetheless be distinct as to the same group of persons.

As an example, income taxation is generally based on the income earned by an individual, and is based on the graduated income tax table. Persons earning less than P250,000 annually are exempt from tax, but those earning P250,001 and above shall pay the corresponding tax. Since the graduated income tax table substantially provided for distinction of classification of taxpayers based on their annual income, then the law is valid.

However, if, say, tax is exempted because he is **`[insert name of person]`**, or that this person cannot be charged with crime because of his wealth, then this act infringes upon the equal protection clause of the Philippine Constitution.
