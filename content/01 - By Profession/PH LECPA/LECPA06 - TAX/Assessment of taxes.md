Assessment of taxes refers to the government’s power to assess/compute the tax due of a taxpayer. The following entities are responsible for the assessment of tax due thereon:

- [[Bureau of Internal Revenue|Bureau of Internal Revenue]], for [[national tax|national tax]].
- [[Bureau of Customs|Bureau of Customs]], for custom duties.
- [[Local Government|Local Government]], for [[local tax|local tax]]

Generally, administrative remedies- that is, those remedies availed of of a taxpayer with a government agency under the Executive Department- must be availed by the taxpayer before resorting to judicial remedies. The [[Court of Tax Appeals|Court of Tax Appeals]] exercises exclusive jurisdiction for cases involving internal revenue, and may also include criminal cases associated with taxes.

> Summary remedies, or those remedies executed without ceremony or delay, are usually done during [[Collection of taxes|Collection of taxes]].

Recall: [[Introduction to the Philippine Constitution|Introduction to the Philippine Constitution]]

## In the case of national taxes
Assessment of taxes due by a taxpayer are guided by the provisions of [[National Internal Revenue Code|National Internal Revenue Code]]. The primary agency responsible for administrative remedies is the [[Bureau of Internal Revenue|Bureau of Internal Revenue]].

A taxpayer, as amended by the [[Ease of Paying Taxes Act|Ease of Paying Taxes Act]], is classified based on their gross sales amount:
- **Micro taxpayer**, below 3 million;
- **Small taxpayer**, below 20 million;
- **Medium taxpayer**, below 1 billion; and
- **Large taxpayer**, 1 billion and up.

Also see: [[Classification of taxpayers according to EOPT|Classification of taxpayers according to EOPT]]

Based on their classification, assessment cases involving micro, small, and medium taxpayers are handled by a [[Revenue District Office|Revenue District Office]] signed by a Regional Director, while large taxpayers are handled by the Large Taxpayer Service Audit Division (LTSAD) signed by the Assistant Commissioner. 

However, in some special cases, the national office, or a special investigation division therein, may investigate large taxpayers that are of significant concern. These operate directly under the Office of the Commissioner.

A taxpayer is selected for assessment if:
- if their business is in a high-risk industry;
- if their business is designated by the Bureau as top audit priorities;
- if their business is reported by another person; or
- during the execution of programs by the government, such as Tax Compliance Verification Drives (or Tax Mapping).

### Administrative Remedies
Administrative remedies availed of by a taxpayer shall be within the 3-year prescriptive period from the [[Filing Deadlines for National Taxes|deadline]] or filing date of a tax return, whichever is late. However, cases involving the non-filing of a tax return or its fraudulent return lapse in a 10-year period upon discovery thereof.[^1]

During this period, the following events must occur:
1. A [[Letter Notice|Letter Notice]] is issued by the BIR if significant discrepancies exist on the filed returns of a taxpayer when matched against the records in their system.
2. A [[Letter of Authority|Letter of Authority]][^2] grants the BIR to conduct tax audits of a taxpayer’s books. This is generally the case if the subject tax is related to the ordinary course of the taxpayer’s business.[^3] It is served **30 days** from the date indicated in the letter, and grants the BIR **120 days** to conduct tax audit, but may be revalidated and extended[^4] based on the taxpayer’s classification.
3. A [[Notice of Discrepancy|Notice of Discrepancy]] informs the taxpayer that, as a result of audit, discrepancies exist between the tax paid and tax due computed by the BIR. It shall be held within **5 days** upon issuance of such notice, up to a maximum period of **30 days**.
4. A [[Preliminary Assessment Notice|Preliminary Assessment Notice]] is issued for line-items that are left unresolved during the tax audit, or after a discussion of discrepancies, there still exists unresolved items. The taxpayer may reply to the PAN through the filing a dispute to the BIR within a period of **15 days** upon receipt thereof.[^5]
5. A [[Final Assessment Notice|Final Assessment Notice]] is issued after the reply of the taxpayer to the PAN or upon the lapse of the 15 days period. The FAN, sometimes referred to as a *Formal Letter of Demand*, imposes the taxpayer to pay the assessed tax. The taxpayer shall have **30 days** after receipt of a FAN to file for the below mentioned motions, and the BIR shall reply to such motion within a period of **180 days**:[^6]
	1. *Motion for Reinvestigation*, if additional pieces of evidence will be submitted to the BIR within **60 days** after filing this motion; or
	2. *Motion for reconsideration*, if disputes are from the legal facts or issues provided by the BIR.
6. A [[Final Decision on Disputed Assessment|Final Decision on Disputed Assessment]] is the reply of the BIR upon further dispute by the taxpayer after issuance of a FAN. Upon the issuance thereof, or upon the lapse of the 180 day period from issuance of FAN,[^7] the taxpayer has **30 days** to file a case to the [[Court of Tax Appeals|Court of Tax Appeals]] in division.

The BIR may only collect the total tax due against a taxpayer if a case has reached administrative finality. The period to commence an action to collect against a taxpayer is within a period of **5 years** upon finality of a decision.

### Judicial Remedies
Judicial remedies[^8] can be availed by a taxpayer if all administrative remedies have already been exhausted and an administrative decision has reached finality.[^7]

The process for judicial remedies are as follow:
1. 30 days upon issuance of an FDDA or lapse of the period for FAN, file a petition for reconsideration to the CTA in division.
2. **15 days** upon decision, file a petition for review on certiorari[^9] to the CTA *en banc*.
3. **15 days** upon decision, file a petition for reconsideration to the [[Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] in division.
4. **15 days** upon decision, file a petition for review on certiorari[^9] to the SC *en banc*.

The BIR, upon decision of a judicial case (and upon finality) shall collect the taxes due within a period of **3 years** upon finality of a judicial case.

[^1]: Explained simply, all administrative actions by the government shall be within the prescriptive period up until the issuance of a [[Final Assessment Notice|Final Assessment Notice]]. If the BIR issues an FLD 3 years and 1 day after the deadline or filing of tax return, whichever is late, such FLD becomes void, unless the taxpayer, by its own volition, signs a [[Waiver of the Defence of Prescription|Waiver of the Defence of Prescription]] as a public document.
[^2]: Note that all filed tax returns to the BIR is checked for mathematical accuracy regardless if there is a Letter of Authority issued by the BIR or not. This is a pre-audit task of the BIR, and not an actual tax audit.
[^3]: However, for one-time special transactions, a [[Tax Verification Notice|Tax Verification Notice]] is used.
[^4]: A letter of authority may be revalidated/extended based on the classification of a taxpayer. In the case of micro, small, and medium taxpayers, it may only be revalidated once. In the case of large taxpayers, it may be revalidated twice.
[^5]: The non-reply of the taxpayer to the PAN does not preclude them to avail of other remedies available in the succeeding steps.
[^6]: In case of a motion for reinvestigation, the period of 180 days begins upon submission by a taxpayer of additional pieces of evidence to the BIR.
[^7]: FAN → FDDA issued, 30 days upon issuance of FDDA. However, if FAN is issued but no FDDA, upon the lapse of the 180 day period from receipt of FAN, the taxpayer has 30 days to file a case to the Court of Tax Appeals. In the latter instance, it is assumed that the BIR’s FAN is the final decision.
[^8]: Note that courts interpret filing periods strictly in the interest of finality and efficiency.
[^9]: The terms *petition for review on certiorari* and *petition for review* are interchangeable terms. However, a *petition for certiorari* is a different kind.
