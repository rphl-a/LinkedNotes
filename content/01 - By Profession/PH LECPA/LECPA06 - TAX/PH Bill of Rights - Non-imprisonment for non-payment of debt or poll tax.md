> **ARTICLE III SECTION 20**. No person shall be imprisoned for debt or non-payment of a poll tax.

Generally, this only applies if its non-payment is made in good faith by the debtor. However, if it is made in bad faith, or with malice, or with the intention to defraud, then the debtor may be liable for crimes and cause their imprisonment as may be provided by law.

Note that poll tax refers to community tax, but not tax generally. Meaning, the non-payment of other forms of tax, such as income taxation, is categorized as *tax evasion* and may result to oneâ€™s imprisonment.
