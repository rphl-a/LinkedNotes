*Because I always tend to forget the difference between these two🤦‍♂️*

A judicial entity refers to an agency of the government performing judicial functions- i.e., the settling of cases of controversies or of interpreting the law. It includes courts organized under the Judicial Department reigned by one Supreme Court, as well as its special courts as may be created.

> A government agency may also perform *quasi-judicial functions*. Examples include cases filed to the Department of Justice, or of the Department of Labour and Employment, or of the Department of Trade and Industry.

Meanwhile, a juridical entity is a person other than a human being to which the law grants a juridical personality. Article 44 of the [[Civil Code|Civil Code]] defines as such to wit:

> The following are juridical persons:
> 1. The State and its political subdivisions
> 2. Other corporations, institutions and entities for public interest or purpose, created by law; their personality begins as soon as they have been constituted according to law;
> 3. Corporations, partnerships and associations for private interest or purpose to which the law grants a juridical personality, separate and distinct from that of each shareholder, partner, or member.
