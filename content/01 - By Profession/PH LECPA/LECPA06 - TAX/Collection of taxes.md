After tax audit by the [[Bureau of Internal Revenue|Bureau of Internal Revenue]], a taxpayer is then collected its basic tax due. Prescriptive period for collection of taxes may either be:
- **5 years**, in case of ==administrative finality==; **or**
- **3 years**, in case of ==judicial finality==.

In collecting delinquent taxes, the BIR may resort to:
- **[[Distraint|Distraint]]**, which is the seizure of personal properties.
- **[[Levy|Levy]]**, which is the seizure of real properties.
- **Judicial proceedings**; a civil case for collection or a criminal case for fraud or tax evasion.

The BIR issues a warrant of distraint or levy multiple times for as long as there are tax debts against a taxpayer.
