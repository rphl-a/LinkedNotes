## Notes
- Gross income w/ Drills (1h 6m) ==DONE==
	- Income tax is based on the *ability to pay* theory.
	- What is “income” for tax purposes
		- Distinct from “income” definition by Financial Accounting
		- It is referred to as `gross income` → income that will be included in tax
		- Exclusions from gross income → items that will not be included
		- Official definition provided by a Revenue Regulation: **All wealth which flows into the taxpayer other than a mere return of capital and includes gains**.
			- Broad coverage, and may include donation and inheritance.
	- Characteristics of gross income in order to determine whether an income is taxable or not (all requirements:
		- Exhibits a return on capital
			- Return on capital is the net between the selling price and cost of a particular transaction for goods and merchandise (i.e., gain)
			- Gross income for sales of services is the actual revenue earned in rendering a service.
			- Essentially, gross income → gross revenue (i.e., sales - COGS)
			- Two classification of capital items:
				- With infinite value → if these are impaired and then replaced, there is no income derived from these items. It is purely a return of capital (instead of return on capital)
					- Examples: Life (Life Insurance), Health, and Reputation. These items cannot be recognized financially.
						- Life insurance → if received by other beneficiaries (upon death), it is still not taxable. Considered as recovery from future losses. However, if endowed, and with *cash surrender value*, then the excess is considered as income.
							- On case of assignees, it is different. Assignees are those whose policy is sold to another people, and the same buys the same.
							- Any consideration received here forth are not taxable.
						- Health → accidents, etc.
							- Hospital bills → Not taxable
							- Attorney’s fees → Not taxable
							- ==Lost salaries → Taxable==
							- Pain and suffering → Not taxable
							- Recovery of lost capital → reverts to your previous net worth
						- Reputation
							- Examples: breach of promise to marry, Alienation of affection (mistress)
				- With finite value → composed of return *of* and return *on*. Note that the item being taxed is return on capital.
					- Return of lost profits (note: profits, instead of capital) are taxable. Examples include:
						- Proceeds from crop or livestock insurance
						- Damages under intellectual property (IP) infringement suit
						- Guarantee income payments
							- Ex.: 500K guaranteed income, but only 400K. One partner provides deficient 100K. The gross income is still 500K.
		- Exhibits realized benefit (actual or constructive receipt of in cash; results to increase in net worth) and is *actually realized*.
			- Examples include donation, inheritance, gain on sale, holding gains (fair value increased)
				- Donation, inheritance, gain on sale, holding gains → results to increase in net worth
					- However, donation, inheritance, and holding gains are not realized. Hence, not taxable. Only gain on sale are taxable.
						- Realized transactions are:
							- Those with exchange (i.e., a sale or **barter** has transpired)
								- Barters are indirect sales
							- Involvement of other persons (natural or juridical)
								- Sole proprietorships are taxable at the individual (natural) person level.
								- Company and its subsidiary are different juridical persons. Hence, transactions between them are taxable.
				- Loans → do not result to increase in net worth
				- Being based on *ability to pay theory*, hence, sales should be taxable only when realized.
		- Not exempted by law, treaty, Constitution and contracts
			- Memorize exemptions provided by PH Constitution and law.
	- **See notes/handouts on HO03**
- Income taxpayers w/ Drills (46m) ==DONE==
	- Gross income as “reported and taxable” or not yet taxable.
	- Gross income items:
		- Final income taxation
		- Capital gains taxation
		- Regular income taxation
	- Classification of taxpayers:
		- Natural persons (or individuals); and
		- Juridical persons (or those created by law)
			- Rules applicable for joint ventures also apply to corporations
		- Any person, whether natural or juridical, is subject to tax.
	- Individuals:
		- Citizen → Filipinos, whether natural born or naturalized.
			- Resident citizen → within the PH (normal)
			- Non-resident citizen → OFWs
		- Aliens → non-Filipinos.
			- Resident alien → within the PH
			- Non-resident alien → outside the PH (normal)
				- Engaged in business
				- Not-engaged in business (normal)
		- Classification rules:
			- **Intention** or nature of them being a resident or non-resident in PH- is it short-term or long-term?
				- Tourist visa → short-term
				- Working/immigration visa → long-term
				- If no document supporting travel, then we resort to *actual length of stay*
			- **Actual length of stay**:
				- NRC if ≥ 183 days (more than or equal to)
					- Because RCs and Domestic Corps are taxable within and without the Philippines. Preferential on their end since they enjoy benefits (i.e., benefits received theory, etc.)
				- NRAETB if > 180 days (more than 180 days)
				- RA if > 1 year
	- Corporations
		- Domestic → incorporated in the PH according to PH laws, regardless of ownership.
			- If Foreign Corporation has subsidiary in PH, then that subsidiary is considered as domestic
		- Foreign → not incorporated by PH laws.
			- Resident foreign corporation → doing business in the Philippines w/ branch or physical establishment.
			- Non-resident foreign corporation → no PH branch or permanent establishment.
	- Other rules to consider for some types of taxpayers (i.e., special considerations)
		- Partnerships
			- General professional partnership → professional partnership. *not a taxpayer/not taxable*
				- Obligations of taxpayer:
					- Withhold ✅
					- Pay ❌
				- Organized for the exercise of a **common profession**. i.e., all partners belong to the same profession.
			- General co-partnership → business partnership *taxpayer under law/taxable*
				- Withhold ✅
				- Pay ✅
				- If partners belong to different professions, then it is a general co-partnership. *Note that partners are different to that of staffs/employees*.
		- Joint Ventures
			- Exempt Joint Ventures under NIRC:
				- JVs engaged in oil exploration or construction
			- Taxable Joint Ventures (generally), considered as corporation
		- Estates (only those items arising after the death)
			- Not a juridical person, but it can be a taxpayer for income tax purposes. Partitioning of properties may either be judicial or extra-judicial
				- Judicial → taxable as an individual (progressive tax table)
				- Extrajudicial → not a taxpayer
					- Heirs will report their share in the estate.
				- [ ] **TODO**: Why tho?
		- Trusts
			- A three party relationship between the grantor, the beneficiary, and the trustee.
			- Properties held in trust may be taxed depending on how the properties are designated to the beneficiary:
				- Revocable → donor still retains control over the ownership- it is *not-taxable* on the end of the beneficiary. Tax is reported to the donor/grantor instead.
				- Irrevocable → taxable on the part of the *trust*.
		- Co-ownerships
			- Joint ownership of an asset, particularly for indivisible properties (ex.: buildings).
			- Normally, co-ownerships are non-taxable.
			- Co-ownerships are merely used to divide the profits derived from such property, or to preserve such property.
				- Generally, it is **tax exempt**. Profits by co-owners are taxable at the individual level.
				- However, if the property is reinvested, then it may become a partnership (general business partnership), and, as such, taxed as a corporation.
- Situs of income (1h 11m) ==DONE==
	- Interest → Debtor’s residence (i.e., the one who owes money *to* the creditor)
	- Dividends
		- Domestic corporations → 100% of dividends is always within the Philippines
		- Foreign corporations → conduct predominance test
			- Predominance test → Where is the dominant income of the corporation. Essentially, the percentage of gross income earned in the Philippines as a percentage of the total gross income of the foreign corporation.
				- Inspect the year of declaration (i.e., 2024). The year inspected is 3 years prior to its current dividend declaration year (i.e., 2021, 2022, and 2023)
				- If PH gross income is < 50%, it is wholly earned outside the PH
				- If PH gross income is ≥ 50%, the portion earned by the foreign corporation (over its total gross income) is used as a multiplier to determine how much of the dividends declared is earned within the Philippines (for taxation purposes).
				- Generally only conducted for resident foreign corporations.
			- **NEW RULE**: If dividends from resident FC is received by a **DC** (intercorporate dividend), then it *may* be considered as exempt.
				- It may be considered as exempt when the pre-dominance test is ≥ 50%. It is similar to that of a DC dividends.
				- If pre-dominance test is <50%, it may still be exempted if:
					- there is at least 20% ownership (to foreign corp)
					- at least 2 years held
					- Dividends are fully utilized before the end of the following year.
	- Service → place where the service is performed/rendered.
		- Made website, and the actual construction of website is external, then outside of PH
		- Marketing, targeted to PH participants, then within PH
	- Rent → location of the property
	- Royalties → place where the intangible is used
	- Gain on sale
		- Real property (immovable/fixed) → location of the property
		- Personal property (movable) → place of sale
			- ==Domestic== securities (shares, stocks, bonds) → always within PH
			- The place of sale is where the place where the seller is located, or where the sale is consumated.
	- Mining → location of mine
	- Farming → location of farm
	- Merchandising → place of sale (see Table 1 below)
	- Manufacturing → place of production **and** place of sale
		- The allocation of manufacturing income is governed by the ==transfer pricing== regulation which mandates measurement of revenue or costs between affiliated enterprises at ==arm’s length price==
			- Transfer pricing rule → at arm’s length
			- Transfer pricing → within the same company (also refer to topic on transfer pricing, MS)
			- Arm’s length rate (or *market rate*) → fair rate of billing between two unrelated and disinterested parties. Applies to sales price and cost of sales price.
				- *Advanced Pricing Agreement*. This is preferred. If APA is absent, use market rate.
	- **HO3 HANDOUTS ANSWER**
		- **TODO**: Mark-up vs Profit margin
- Accounting periods (15m)
	- Regular accounting period (12 months)
		- Calendar → January 01 to December 31 (individual and corporation)
			- For sole proprietors (still considered as individual), still calendar year for tax purposes, regardless of what accounting period is used under GAAP.
		- Fiscal → 1 year duration starting at any month (corporation only)
	- Short accounting period (<12 mos)
		- Example: upon death or dissolvement of taxpayer, death is Sept 15; accounting period is until Sept 15 only.
			- Exception: only for purposes of claiming personal exemptions.
			- [ ] **TODO**: 15 or 30? further research
		- Example: establishment of new business start on Jun 30, then calendar year. Therefore, accounting period is from Jun 30 to Dec 31 only.
		- Example: change in accounting period. Only corporations may opt to change their accounting period.
		- Example: termination of accounting period by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.
			- Reasons or grounds: if intending to leave the country, or removing the properties of the taxpayer in their usual site of business, or doing an act that will obstruct the collection of taxes.
	- Accounting periods are primarily used to determine the deadline of computing for tax returns.
	- Deadline for income tax: **15th day of 4th month following the end of the year.**
- Accounting methods (1h 51m) ==SYNTHESIS STILL DRAFT==
	- Accounting methods are techniques used to measure a taxpayer’s income.
	- Almost similar to cash and accrual basis of FAR/GAAP. However, there are two important modifications because of principles by which tax is grounded to:
		- **Advanced Income is taxable upon receipt**. This is most applicable for service income.
			- For goods and properties, the taxable event is the consummation of sale.
			- Based on lifeblood doctrine- the faster the govt collects tax, the better.
		- **Prepayments are non-deductible**. Prepaid expenses are non-deductible for tax purposes.
			- Because if expenses are taxed when they are to occur in a period later, then tax for current year will be understated (since higher expense). Understatement of tax results to delay of payment of tax owed by the taxpayer to the government. This is also consistent with the lifeblood doctrine.
	- Principal, or *most common*, methods:
		- Cash basis
			- Cash basis net income, FAR
			- Deduct: Prepaid expenses, beginning
			- Add: Prepaid expenses, ending
			- Total: Cash basis net income, tax purposes
		- Accrual basis
			- Accrual net income, FAR
			- Deduct: Advance income, beginning
			- Add: Advance income, ending
			- Total: Accrual net income, tax purposes
		- Hybrid method → combination of cash and accrual basis, or any other accounting methods.
			- Example: two businesses using two separate accounting methods. The income resulting from cash and accrual basis is merely added together to come up with the taxable income of a taxpayer.
		- **See HOs answer, Nos. 08 and 09**
	- Deferred Payment Sales
		- Instalment method → if payments are made over long periods of time
			- Primarily used in the following cases only:
				- Sale of personal property by dealer (can use instalment method anytime)
					- Personal property being sold is within the industry or actual items sold by such dealer in their profession. They are called as *dealers*. If not, then *non-dealers*.
				- Casual sale of personal property where:
					- Initial payment does not exceed 25% of selling price
					- Selling price is over 1K
					- Property is of a kind which would be included in the taxpayer’s inventory if on hand at the close of taxable year
				- Sale of real property where the initial payment does not exceed 25% of the selling price
				- Initial payment → down payment and instalments in the accounting period of the year of sale. *Repeating topic*
			- Generally, instalment amount collected over selling price (i.e., percentage of collected amount over total selling price) multiplied by gross income. Ex.:
				- Selling price 4K
				- COS is 3K
				- GP is 1K
				- Instalment collection over years:
					- 1K for Y1 = (1K/4K) * 1K
					- 2K for Y2 = (2K/4K) * 1K
					- 1K for Y3 = (1K/4K) * 1K
					- (Collection/SP) * GP
			- While already removed in FAR, it is still operative in PH tax *but not preferred or least preferred*.
		- Deferred payment basis → basically, *discounting* on notes using the concept of present value (i.e., cash value + fair value of notes) less residual income. Primarily used if instalment method is not available.
		- See table 3
	- Long-term construction contracts (same as AFAR)
		- Percentage of completion method (architect or engineer certification is required)
		- Completed contract basis
	- Farming income
		- Animals → cash basis or accrual basis
			- Cash basis
			- Accrual basis
		- Crops → depending on the duration of crops
			- Short-term crops → cash or accrual basis
				- Ex.: palay, mais, monggo, peanuts
			- Long-term crops → 
				- Perennial crops (bananas, coconuts)
					- During development years of crop, capitalized
					- During harvest years of crop, amortized over the year of the crop
				- Non-perennial crops
					- Use crop year basis (*it is not an accounting period*, but an accounting method to measure income)
						- All expenses during development years is deducted upon harvest.
	- Leasehold improvement → improvements in land that are left to the lessor if the lessee leaves.
		- Outright method → cost of the improvement (upon completion) is recognized as income
		- Spread-out method → residual value of the improvement, divided over remaining lease term. Example:
			- Useful life: 20 years
			- Lease term: 15 yrs
			- Construction: 2 years
			- Actual usable lease term: 13 years
			- 7 years by lessor/20 years total useful life
			- However, some contract lease may count their lease term upon completion of the improvement in the land/lot.
		- **See HO Excel (see Desktop as inbox)** ==(**1:28:43 ENDPOINT)**==
		- Gain on pre-termination:
			- Outright → no gain, since income is already recognized on Y1
			- Spread-out method → remaining portion 
		- Deductible loss (upon destruction of improvement)
			- Book value at the time it was destroyed will be recorded
		- [ ] **TODO**: Excel method
		- 
- Income tax compliance (1h 1m) ==DONE== ==SYNTHESIS STILL DRAFT==
	- Two-fold obligation of taxpayer:
		- You pay
		- You withhold
			- Final withholding tax → final tax on income of recipient
			- Creditable withholding tax → estimated tax of recipient
	- Tax returns:
		- Two income tax returns → report about your income taxes
			- Regular income tax return
				- 1701 for Individuals
				- 1702 for Corporations
			- Capital gains tax return
				- When we sell certain properties which is defined as *capital assets* under law, specifically, domestic stocks and real properties.
				- 1706 for sales of real property
				- 1707 for sales of stocks
			- Non-filing of income tax return:
				- Government takes basic tax due
				- - 25% surcharge
				- - 12% legal interest per annum
					- OMG 6% LANG LEGAL INTEREST?
					- No. of days / 365 (or 366) days
				- - *Compromise tax table/penalty*
					- Every aspect of non-compliance carries with it a criminal violation. A compromise must be paid for non-filing of criminal charges
				- (Also see topic: on Tax Remedies)
		- Withholding tax returns -> return about pre-deducted taxes against income of other persons
			- Withholding tax on compensation → use the graduated income tax table
			- Final withholding tax → received by recipients for sources of income that are passive by nature.
			- Expanded withholding tax → certain line items of regular income other than compensation. They are active or passive income by nature. Examples include rent and professional fees. *For creditable withholding tax*.
			- Types:
				- Final tax → what is pre-deducted is the final income of said recipient. *Did not file consolidated return*. They are non-creditable.
				- Creditable withholding tax → the tax pre-deducted is merely an estimate. The taxpayer has to consolidate all their income, compute tax due, and deduct those withholding tax. The residual balance is the withholding tax payable.
					- Two types:
						- Withholding tax on compensation
						- Expanded withholding tax
				- Tax overpayment (negative) or tax payable (if positive)
			- The BIR also requires the filing of information returns. Example include the income gained by a general professional partnership (non-taxable). Used to determine the correctness the filing paid by individual taxpayers. Non-compliance will result to PHP 1,000 penalty (up to maximum of PHP 25,000).
			- Penalties are the same as that of penalties and surcharge for income tax returns.
			- Laging may withholding tax returns, even if tax-exempt, because of allowances provided for to employees.
	- Venue of Filing is dependent on taxpayer’s classification
		- Micro-, small-, and medium-taxpayers → within 0 to 999M (also see: taxpayer’s remedies topic) → file at RDO. At any RDO, by effectivity of EOPT
			- Methods:
				- Manual → manual encode, onsite filing, manual payment
				- e-BIR Forms → auto encode, electronic filing, manual payment (online and offline payments)
				- electronic Filing and Payment system → electronic encode (online only), online filing, auto payment (online)
		- Large taxpayers → Directly to the BIR large taxpayers service division national office *or something*
			- Method: strictly eFPS only.
		- Remember: parent and subsidiaries are two separate entities.
		- Large taxpayers:
			- Taxpayments:
				- VAT
				- Income
				- Excise
				- Withholding (any)
				- If Income, Excise, or Withholding exceeds 1M, you are already considered Large
				- If VAT, 200K quarterly limit excess
				- [ ] Further research
			- Financials
				- Sales/Revenues → exceeds 1B
				- Purchases → exceeds 800M
				- Net worth → exceeds 300M
			- Others
		- Make payments to:
			- Authorized agent bank
			- Revenue District Officer
			- Collection Agent
			- Duly authorized Treasurer of the city or municipality where the taxpayer has legal residence or principal place of business
			- Office of the Commissioner (if no legal residence or place of business)
		- Payments of income tax:
			- Regular income tax → outright (lump-sum) or instalment for individual, outright only for corporate taxpayers
				- Individual instalment→ Tax due exceeds 2K
				- Individual Lump sump: 2K and below of tax due
			- Capital gains tax → outright or instalment for individual and corporate
				- Instalment anytime, with certain criteria
		- Determining non-compliance with tax obligations
			- Lifestyle check
			- Inventory surveillance
			- Mystery shopping
			- Networth method (uses SALN)
				- Possible gross income = Personal expenditures + Change in networth
					- Change in networth = Delta between networth for a particular year
					- Possible gross income is generally taxable, except if:
						- It is excluded by law, treaty, public policy from taxation
						- Result from additional investment
						- Is not income for tax purposes (i.e., does not meet the three characteristics of gross income)
