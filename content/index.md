Hello, and welcome to my personal digital garden! This is where I upload my study and synthesis notes from time to time, documenting my learning process as I expand the horizon of my knowledge.

## The Era of Digital Gardens

> “A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organized by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory – notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing.” —[Maggie Appleton, on A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)

With the increasing popularity of note taking tools and their ease of publishing content to the Internet nowadays, I felt that I also need to hop on the digital garden hype train and contribute something for others in the ever-so increasing sprawl of knowledge in the horizon.

*This digital garden is created using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)– a free, markdown-based note-taking tool built primarily on the notion of creating a second brain– and [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)– a static-site generator that transforms Markdown notes into fully functional websites.*
