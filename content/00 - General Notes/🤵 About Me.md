Hello!

My name is Raphael Palisoc Acilo. I am a graduate of the Bachelor of Science in Accountancy program in De La Salle University-Dasmariñas. I have also served the University Student Government from the same educational institution for three administrations. My primary advocacies are primarily focused on continuous process improvement, genuine service, and good governance.

## Background in Computer Technology
My knowledge of computers primarily originated from researching computer parts and optimizations for my own system.

I started using a computer when I was four years old, primarily to play video games, on a laptop equipped with a single-core Intel processor and SiS M661MX Graphics. This was the device I used to aid my studies during my primary education.

Upon graduating elementary school, my parents promised to buy me a new computer. Hence, I researched which computer parts to pick. Ultimately, we settled for a desktop equipped with an Intel Pentium G3240 and 4GB of DDR3 RAM. It was not the best, especially for gaming. My first dedicated graphics card upgrade was a GT730. It wasn’t also great for gaming, but was better than the integrated graphics that came with the CPU. It took some time until my parents gifted me a GTX 1050Ti. It was good for gaming, but the CPU was a bottleneck. I remember playing DotA2 with this computer, averaging around 40 FPS on low, medium, and high settings.

That very same desktop broke during the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, I still do not know the underlying issue, but I think it may have been a memory module or motherboard problem. I knew this day would come, seeing that that desktop only had a generic 500W power supply unit, which is a very bad practice in building computer systems.

Thereafter, I upgraded to an AMD Ryzen 3 3100 with 8GB of DDR4 RAM, thanks to my parents again (hehe). I reused many parts from my old desktop, like my graphics card, storage devices, and computer peripherals, to drive costs down for the new computer. I used this computer until I completed my tertiary education.

I also own an HP Victus gaming laptop, which is also graduation gift for completing tertiary level of education from my parents. This is also my current daily driver, which I use to review in preparation for the Philippine Licensure Exam for Certified Public Accountants.

Lastly, I also used to own these handheld devices:
- [Nokia 2600 classic](https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_2600_classic-2221.php)
- [Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 WiFi](https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_tab_3_7_0_wifi-5423.php)

- [Nokia 6 (2017)](https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_6-6885.php)
- [Nokia 7 Plus](https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_7_plus-9058.php)
- [Oppo Reno4 Z 5G](https://www.gsmarena.com/oppo_reno4_z_5g-10375.php)
- A GameBoy Advance SP device
- Nintendo GameCube
- Play Station Portable (w/ PRO CFW)
- Play Station 2

>[!note]- On Smartphones…
>I also used to jailbreak (i.e., unlock bootloader, root, and install custom recovery) my Android smartphones during the Android 4.0 era– back when the XDA Developers Forum was my go-to website for rooting Android devices. However, seeing that most manufacturers these days lock their bootloaders beyond the reach of consumers, especially for budget and midrange smartphones, I switched to using an iOS device. While iOS devices offer fewer features than their Android counterparts, especially considering the latter’s ability to install almost any application or feature through sideloading, Apple’s consistent security and feature updates are more enticing than the ever-so constricting Android ecosystem nowadays.
