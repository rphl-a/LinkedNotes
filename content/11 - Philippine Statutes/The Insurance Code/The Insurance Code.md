| [[11 - Philippine Statutes/The Insurance Code/Doing an Insurance Business.md\|Doing an Insurance Business]] | The term doing an insurance business or transacting an insurance business, within the meaning of this Code, shall include: 
(1) Making or proposing to make, as insurer, any insurance contract;  
(2) Making or proposing to make, as surety, any contract of suretyship as a vocation and not as merely incidental to any other legitimate business or activity of the surety;  
(3) Doing any kind of business, including a reinsurance business, specifically recognized as constituting the doing of an insurance business within the meaning of this Code;  
(4) Doing or proposing to do any business in substance equivalent to any of the foregoing in a manner designed to evade the provisions of this Code.  

In the application of the provisions of this Code, the fact that no profit is derived from the making of insurance contracts, agreements or transactions or that no separate or direct consideration is received therefor, shall not be deemed conclusive to show that the making thereof does not constitute the doing or transacting of an insurance business. |
