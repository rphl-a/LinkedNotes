Beta testing refers to the act of implementing a new idea, system, or product to only a select group of people in a controlled environment as much as possible. Through beta testing, problems are weeded out by the testers before its release en masse.

Beta testing reduces the risks and costs inherent in launching an unproven product or system to a widespread audience.
