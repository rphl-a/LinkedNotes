- Lean Process Management
	- Can be applied to processes that involve the movement or creation of goods or services
	- Similarity with Six Sigma:
		- Continuous improvement (Kaizen)
			- Lean provides waste-removal tools
		- Applied in a whole-of-organization approach (as a culture)
- Total Quality Management
	- Depended on the way the program is implemented and the culture of the organization
	- Successful TQM initiatives require eight key elements:
		- Ethics, Integrity, Trust, Training, Teamwork, Leadership, Recognition, and Communication
- Business Process Reengineering
	- More concerned with radical change across an entire organization or process architecture
	- Planning
	- Designing
	- Testing
		- Sandbox testing
		- QA testing by trained technical resources
		- Beta testing
		- Phased rollouts
- Rummler-Brache
	- Implemented bits and pieces of methods that incorporated Lean and Six Sigma elements
	- Pioneered by Geary Rummler and Alan Brache (1980s)
	- Nine Boxes model
		- Performance levels
			- Performer
			- Process
			- Organization
		- Performance dimensions
			- Management
			- Design
			- Goal
	- Phases:
		- Improvement Planning
		- Definition
		- Analysis and Design
		- Implementation
		- Management of Process
- Scrum
	- Relevant if teams want to create new technical products or integrate new developments on existing products within a short time frame.
	- Phases:
		- Pregame
		- Game
		- Postgame
- The Customer Experience Management Method (CEM)
	- Takes an outside-in approach, focusing on what the customer wants or needs and how each process in an organization serves that need.
	- Advantage: organizations being able to deploy customer-facing tactics across the enterprise, which results to gains in customer satisfaction, loyalty, and spending.
	- Disadvantage: traditionally inward-facing departments, such as HR, legal, and accounting, have a difficult time implementing a customer-focused cultural change.
- JumpStart
	- Fast paced method for identifying problems and solutions in a single session.
	- Should not be used to enact sweeping changes or improve processes that can seriously impact customer experience
	- Safe for inner-team changes, but dangerous for department or enterprise-wide processes
- When to use Six Sigma:
	- When facing the unknown
	- When problems are widespread and not defined
	- When solving complex problems
	- When costs are closely tied to processes
