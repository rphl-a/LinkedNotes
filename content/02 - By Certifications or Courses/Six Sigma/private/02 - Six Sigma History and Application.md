- Six Sigma applies statistics to define, measure, analyze, verify, and control processes.
	- DMAIC is used to improve a process that already exists
		- Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control
	- DMADV is used when developing a new process
		- Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, and Verify
- Normal curve by Carl Friedrich Gauss (19th Century)
	- As the root of statistical process control
- Errors and costs exponentially increases as sigma level decreases
- Walter Shewhart (20th Century)
	- First person to closely relate sigma level and quality
	- Control charts
		- The plan-do-check-act cycle as a core tenet for Six Sigma
			- Developed by W. Edwards Deming.
- W. Edwards Deming became a valued teacher and consultant to manufacturing companies in Japan, planting the ideas and concepts that would soon become the Toyota Production System, or Lean Six Sigma.
	- Eiji Toyoda and Taiichi Ohno introduced concepts known as Just-in-Time and judoka, which are the pillars of the Toyota Production System.
- Engineer Bill Smith and Dr. Mikel Harry worked at Motorola. They were instructed by Bob Galvin (CEO) to see a ten-fold improvement in half a decade following their observation in a manufacturing plant taken over by Japan- that it resulted in 1/20th of the amounts of defects as Motorolaâ€™s own television sets.
	- They perfected the Six Sigma methodology
	- Galvin then instructed the team to share Six Sigma to the world.
